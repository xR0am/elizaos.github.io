Polling works, Posting works, but bot ignores all mentions.\n\n**To Reproduce**\n\n- Install elizaOS\n- add twitter logins and LLM API on .env (also using plugin-dkg but that does not trigger when my bot does not manage to reply to mentions)\n- run a character\n\n**Expected behavior**\n\nReplying to TWITTER_TARGET_USERS when mentioned. However, I see INSTRUCTIONS on the logs but nothing happens and LLM does not make a decision, and then INSTRUCTIONS keep on looping. Logs also say already responded to tweet but bot did not answer anything. Polling seems to work, actions like retweeting and liking are fine, but responding to mentions do not work. \n\n**Logs**\n\ntweet 1910392689352122568, skipping\"}\n{\"hostname\":\"x\",\"msg\":\"Already responded to tweet 1910483748778279051, skipping\"}\n{\"hostname\":\"x\",\"msg\":\"Already responded to tweet 1911051920707289251, skipping\"}\n{\"hostname\":\"x\",\"msg\":\"Already responded to tweet 1911059279173370026, skipping\"}\n{\"hostname\":\"x\",\"msg\":\"Finished checking Twitter interactions\"}\n{\"hostname\":\"x\",\"msg\":\"Attempting to generate text with context: # INSTRUCTIONS: Determine if Beezle (@otnoderunner) should respond to the message and participate in the conversation.

I modified the agent\u2019s index.ts file (referred to as the \u201cforce start Discord client\u201d block) to force-start a Discord client with additional event listeners. The logs indicate the Discord client logs in successfully and even logs the incoming messages:\n\nForced Discord client logged in as Suzy Mero Steele#5510!\nDiscord message received: <@...> Hello traveler\n\nHowever, despite this, the integration does not trigger any internal agent interactions\u2014the bot receives messages but does not forward them to the agent\u2019s processing logic, and Telegram does not seem to initialize at all.\n\n**Other Checks:**\n\nI verified that port configurations (such as port 3000 switching to 3001) and other settings (like health endpoints) are working as expected. I confirmed that the character configuration includes \"discord\" and \"telegram\" with the correct secrets. I added additional debug logging in the agent index file to trace the plugin and client initialization steps. Despite all these debugging steps, the full agent startup logs show that while the agent itself initializes (using Google Gemini as the selected model provider, etc.), the Discord and Telegram integrations remain isolated\u2014the Discord client appears online and logs incoming messages (when forced) but these messages are never forwarded to the agent\u2019s internal interaction flow.\n\n**Expected vs. Actual Behavior:**\n\n**Expected:**  \n\nWhen starting the agent with my character configuration, the Discord and Telegram clients should initialize, and incoming messages received on Discord (and Telegram) should be routed into the agent\u2019s processing logic\u2014triggering interactions or automated responses (enabled by the built-in message handling in Eliza OS).\n\n**Actual:**  \n\nAlthough the standalone test demonstrates that the Discord client can log in and echo messages successfully, when the agent is started through the full startup process, the Discord client (and similarly the Telegram client) do not appear to be linked to the agent\u2019s messaging system. The bot appears online and logs indicate that messages are received, but there is no subsequent interaction or forwarding of those messages into the agent\u2019s core processing logic.\n\n\n**Request:**\n\nI\u2019m looking for guidance on how to properly link the external Discord and Telegram events into the Eliza OS agent\u2019s internal processing pipeline so that the clients become fully interactive. Any help pinpointing where the integration might be breaking down (in the DirectClient or plugin initialization) or suggestions on configuration/network considerations in a WSL2 environment would be greatly appreciated.\n\nFeel free to ask for any additional details or logs if needed. Thank you!\n\n", "CLOSED", 0, "zacmero", "2025-03-06T03:57:35Z", "2025-04-12T18:32:38Z", "2025-04-12T18:32:38Z", "elizaos/eliza", "2025-04-12 23:03:35"]

Please describe.**\n\nThis is a problem in that I'm trying to build a platform agnostic core package but eliza has no way of injecting specific platforms into it. It also seems like I will have to pollyfill some node.js libraries to use elizav2 core package\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nV2 is super clean but it really needs a platform abstraction. \n\n```typescript\ninterface Platform {\n  name: string\n  readFile?: typeof fs.readFile\n  ...etc\n}\n\nclass NodePlatform implements Platform {\n  name: 'NODEJS'\n  readFile fs.readFile\n  ..etc\n} \n```\n\nSuch that now \n- the entire core package has no platform specific logic in it. Less complexity\n- no imports (except typescript types)  in core package reference a node.js module. No need to polyfill\n- Flexible to provide our own platform for say bun if bun has a node incompatability causing issue in eliza or being in the browser but emulating a file system, etc.\n\nThis is a common pattern in other libraries such as [effect.ts](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/platform)\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\nAnother option would be to create seperate packages core-web, core-node.

Increased system load from repeated processing of the same data\n\n## Possible Solutions\n1. Implement a cursor-based pagination system to only fetch new tweets\n2.

Configure Twitter plugin with valid credentials\n2. Have someone mention your Twitter bot\n3. Check logs for duplicate key errors\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe bot should create only one memory record per tweet mention and handle all interactions without database errors.\n\n**Root cause**\nThe issue occurs because `handleTwitterInteractions()` creates a memory record and then calls `handleTweet()` which tries to create the same memory again:\n1. First creation in `handleTwitterInteractions()` around line 227\n2. Second creation in `handleTweet()` around line 642\n\n## Issue 2: Null Post Interval Configuration\n\n**Describe the bug**\nThe Twitter post interval configuration is not being properly read, resulting in null values in the logs:\n\n```\n[2025-03-30 05:31:09] LOG: - Post Interval: null-null minutes\n```\n\n**To Reproduce**\n1. Configure Twitter plugin with a valid post interval setting\n2. Check logs to see that the interval is showing as null-null minutes\n\n**Expected behavior**\nThe logs should correctly show the configured post interval, such as \"Post Interval: 30-60 minutes\" if configured with those values.\n\n**Additional context**\nThe post interval configuration appears to be properly set in the config files, but the system is not reading or applying these values correctly. This may affect the bot's posting schedule.\n\nThese two bugs should be fixed separately as they affect different aspects of the Twitter plugin functionality:\n1.

The goal is to establish a decentralized, automated registry system that allows bots to discover and authenticate each other. Once connected, the bots will communicate through a private back channel to exchange data and execute trades efficiently.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Features**:\r\n\r\n1. **Automated Registry System**: \r\n   - Each bot will register itself in a decentralized registry (e.g., using a lightweight P2P network or distributed ledger technology).\r\n   - Bots will periodically update the registry, checking for new bots or changes in status.\r\n   - The registry will include basic metadata to facilitate discovery, like cryptographic keys for authentication.\r\n   - Possibly services a particular bot provides to other bots that they could pay for in the future. (more on this later)\r\n\r\n2. **Private Back Channel Communication**:\r\n   - Implement a secure, real-time communication protocol, potentially leveraging WebRTC or a similar P2P technology.\r\n   - The protocol should ensure encrypted communication between bots, minimizing the risk of interception.\r\n   - Messages will be designed for minimal latency, suitable for rapid data exchange and trading negotiations.\r\n\r\n3. **Authentication and Security**:\r\n   - Use public-private key cryptography for bot authentication, ensuring only legitimate bots can participate in the network.\r\n   - Establish rules for trust and security, with mechanisms to handle untrusted or malicious bots.\r\n\r\n4. **Efficient Trading Protocol**:\r\n   - Design a protocol that allows bots to share and match order books in a streamlined manner.\r\n   - Ensure trades are executed quickly, with minimal delay, using predefined negotiation rules.\r\n   - Incorporate a fallback mechanism if communication or negotiation fails.\r\n\r\n**Benefits**:\r\n- **Speed**: A dedicated, private communication channel will facilitate faster data exchange compared to public platforms.\r\n- **Security**: Encrypted communication ensures that sensitive trading data remains confidential.\r\n- **Scalability**: The decentralized nature of the registry will support the growth of the network without becoming a bottleneck.\r\n\r\n**Considerations**:\r\n- The system should be resilient to potential attacks, like Sybil attacks, by incorporating strong authentication and trust mechanisms.\r\n- Developing a lightweight and efficient protocol is critical to minimize resource usage and latency.\r\n", "CLOSED", 0, "sirkitree", "2024-11-13T15:14:08Z", "2024-11-15T14:12:13Z", "2024-11-15T14:12:13Z", "elizaos/eliza", "2025-04-14 21:50:20"]

This step initially failed due to redirect URI mismatch but was resolved after fixing .env and redirect configurations.\r\n\r\nSuccessfully retrieved an access token but encountered a 403 Forbidden error when attempting to post a tweet using the provided access token.\r\n\r\nOther Efforts:\r\nTested multiple approaches to ensure the server was running properly (ngrok tunnel, express server for callback handling).\r\n\r\nUsed the provided Eliza example retry mechanisms, cookies validation steps, and OAuth2 flows, but no approach successfully enabled the bot to interact with Twitter.\r\n\r\nTechnical Environment:\r\n\r\nEliza Package Version: 0.1.4-alpha.3\r\nNode.js Version: v23.0.0\r\nTwitter API Version: v2\r\nPlan: Free tier with 100 monthly interactions allowed.\r\nErrors Encountered:\r\n\r\nCookies Authentication Error: Session is invalid. Login required.\r\nOAuth2 Access Token Exchange Error: \"Value passed for the redirect uri did not match the uri of the authorization code.\"\r\nOAuth2 Post Tweet Error:\r\n{\r\n  \"title\": \"Forbidden\",\r\n  \"type\": \"about:blank\",\r\n  \"status\": 403,\r\n  \"detail\": \"Forbidden\"\r\n}\r\n\r\nWhat We\u2019ve Tried:\r\n\r\nFollowed the Eliza documentation for both cookies-based login and OAuth2 authentication.\r\nValidated cookies format, paths, and domains. Adjusted callback URLs to match the redirect URI.\r\nEnsured correct scopes (tweet.read, tweet.write, offline.access) were included in the authorization URL. Searched for solutions in related GitHub issues and documentation but could not resolve these issues.\r\n\r\nQuestions:\r\n\r\nCookies-based login: Is there an additional step needed to validate or reuse cookies without triggering suspicious login alerts?\r\n\r\nOAuth2 Post Tweet Forbidden: Are there any known limitations or configurations for the free tier that could block posting tweets, even after successfully obtaining an access token?\r\n\r\nDocumentation Alignment: Are there updated instructions or examples specific to the latest Twitter API v2 and free-tier limitations that might clarify the proper setup?\r\n\r\nAdditional Notes:\r\n\r\nThe primary goal is to enable the Eliza bot to post tweets under the speedcto account using either method (cookies or OAuth2).\r\n\r\nThe free-tier plan should suffice for our initial testing (17 tweets/day, 100 interactions/month).\r\nAny guidance or updates on how to resolve these issues would be highly appreciated!", "CLOSED", 0, "Travellereleven", "2024-12-07T15:39:33Z", "2024-12-08T17:50:47Z", "2024-12-08T17:50:47Z", "elizaos/eliza", "2025-04-14 21:50:27"]

While we have the infrastructure to create releases, we currently face challenges in ensuring that these releases are reliable and stable. The key issues are:\r\n\r\n- **Broken Test Suite:** Our automated tests are failing, which means we cannot confidently verify the stability and functionality of new code changes.\r\n- **Rapid Code Changes:** With many contributors and fast-moving code, it's difficult to track and integrate changes without introducing new bugs.\r\n- **Unreliable Releases:** Without a consistent and dependable release process, we risk distributing versions of our project that may not meet quality standards.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Proposed Solution:**\r\n\r\nTo overcome these challenges and establish a reliable release process, we propose the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. **Prioritize Fixing the Tests:**\r\n   - **Assess and Repair Tests:** Identify all failing tests and determine the causes. Fix broken tests to ensure they accurately reflect code functionality.\r\n   - **Community Involvement:** Encourage contributors to help fix tests by creating specific issues and assigning tasks.\r\n   - Testing issues can be found with the 'testing' label: https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atesting\r\n\r\n2. **Establish Continuous Integration (CI):**\r\n   - **Automate Testing:** Set up a CI system to automatically run the test suite on every commit and pull request. For the most part this is already in place but only runs a basic test currently.\r\n   - **Enforce Test Passing:** Configure the CI to block merging of code that doesn't pass all tests, keeping the main branch stable. We currently have these running on every pull request, but it's not a blocking rule.\r\n\r\n3. **Implement a Branching Strategy:**\r\n   - **Use Feature Branches:** Have contributors work on separate branches for new features or fixes to isolate changes. For the most part this is happening already.\r\n   - **Adopt Release Branches:** Create dedicated branches for preparing releases, allowing for final testing and stabilization.\r\n\r\n4. **Define a Release Workflow:**\r\n   - **Release Types:** Clearly define different release types (e.g., alpha, beta, stable) and their purposes.\r\n   - **Semantic Versioning:** Use semantic versioning to communicate the nature of changes in each release.\r\n\r\n5. **Automate the Release Process:**\r\n   - **Automated Builds and Tagging:** Utilize tools to automate the building of releases and tagging of versions.\r\n   - **Generate Release Notes:** Automatically create release notes from commit messages to document changes. This is already in place and is updated when a tag is created through CI: https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md\r\n\r\n6. **Establish Release Criteria:**\r\n   - **Set Clear Requirements:** Define what must be completed before a release (passing tests, code reviews, updated documentation).\r\n   - **Use a Release Checklist:** Implement a checklist to ensure all criteria are met before releasing.\r\n\r\n7. **Enhance Collaboration and Communication:**\r\n   - **Regular Updates:** Hold regular meetings or send updates to keep everyone informed about release progress.\r\n   - **Transparency:** Make the release roadmap and plans accessible to all contributors.\r\n\r\n8. **Implement Code Reviews and Quality Assurance:**\r\n   - **Mandatory Code Reviews:** Require that all code changes are reviewed by at least one other contributor. We've talked about this in discord, but it hasn't been implemented as a rule yet.\r\n   - **Use Quality Tools:** Integrate static analysis and other quality assurance tools to catch issues early.\r\n\r\n9. **Plan for Different Release Channels:**\r\n   - **Stable Releases:** Provide thoroughly tested versions for general use.\r\n   - **Beta and Nightly Builds:** Offer less stable versions for testing new features and gathering feedback.\r\n\r\n10. **Monitor and Iterate:**\r\n    - **Collect Feedback:** After each release, gather input from users and contributors to identify improvements.\r\n    - **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly refine the release process based on feedback and performance metrics.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**Next Steps:**\r\n\r\n- **Immediate Actions:**\r\n  - **Fix the Test Suite:** Prioritize repairing all broken tests with the help of the community.\r\n  - **Set Up CI System:** Implement a continuous integration pipeline to automate testing and enforce code quality.\r\n\r\n- **Community Engagement:**\r\n  - **Communicate Plans:** Share this proposed solution with the community to align efforts and expectations.\r\n  - **Encourage Participation:** Invite contributors to take active roles in improving the testing and release processes.\r\n\r\n- **Documentation:**\r\n  - **Create Guidelines:** Document the release workflow, branching strategy, and contribution guidelines.\r\n  - **Provide Resources:** Offer tutorials or guides on how to work with the new processes and tools.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nBy taking these steps, we aim to build a robust and reliable release process that can handle rapid development while maintaining high-quality standards.

This distributed development model is a strength, but it also creates a challenge: managing code divergence and ensuring interoperability across the growing Eliza ecosystem. This ticket aims to establish a community-driven plan for addressing this challenge, fostering collaboration, and maximizing code reuse while allowing for customization and innovation within individual forks.\r\n\r\n**Problem:**\r\n\r\n* **Multiple Diverging Forks:** As more developers fork Eliza, the ecosystem will naturally fragment into various specialized implementations.\r\n* **Increased Merge Complexity:** Merging changes between forks, or between forks and the main repository, will become increasingly complex and error-prone as divergence increases.\r\n* **Maintenance Overhead:**  Each fork incurs its own maintenance burden, requiring developers to track upstream changes, resolve merge conflicts, and ensure compatibility.\r\n* **Duplication of Effort and Reinventing the Wheel:** Developers in different forks might unknowingly duplicate efforts by re-implementing similar features.\r\n* **Reduced Interoperability:**  Divergence can lead to reduced interoperability between different Eliza agents or implementations.\r\n\r\n**Goals:**\r\n\r\n* **Minimize Divergence (Where Feasible):** Encourage practices that minimize unnecessary code divergence across forks.\r\n* **Facilitate Collaboration and Knowledge Sharing:** Foster communication and collaboration between maintainers of different forks and the core Eliza team.\r\n* **Streamline Merging and Integration:** Establish best practices and potentially develop tools for efficiently merging changes between forks and the main repository.\r\n* **Maximize Code Reuse:**  Promote modular design and encourage the development of reusable plugins and components that can be shared across the ecosystem.\r\n* **Maintain Core Eliza Stability:**  Ensure that core Eliza functionality remains stable and reliable while allowing for innovation and customization within forks.\r\n\r\n**Near-Term Plan (Community-Driven):**\r\n\r\n1. **Fork Registry (Website or GitHub Page):** Create a central registry of known Eliza forks. This registry could include project descriptions, contact information for maintainers, and links to the forked repositories.  This facilitates discovery and collaboration.\r\n\r\n2. **Communication Channels (Discord, Forum):**  Establish dedicated communication channels (e.g., a Discord server, a forum category) for discussing fork management, sharing best practices, and coordinating development efforts.\r\n\r\n3. **Modularization and Plugin Development:**  Encourage developers to refactor fork-specific code into modular plugins or extensions that can be easily shared and integrated with other Eliza implementations.\r\n\r\n4. **Standardized Plugin Interface:**  Develop and document a clear, standardized interface for creating Eliza plugins.  This promotes interoperability and simplifies plugin integration.\r\n\r\n5. **Shared Test Suite:**  Create a shared test suite that covers core Eliza functionality.  Encourage fork maintainers to incorporate this test suite into their continuous integration pipelines to ensure compatibility.\r\n\r\n6. **Documentation:**  Create documentation and tutorials on best practices for forking Eliza, managing divergence, and contributing back to the ecosystem.\r\n\r\n**Future Considerations (Speculative):**\r\n\r\n1. **Automated Merging Tools:**  Explore and potentially develop automated merging tools that can help resolve conflicts and integrate changes between forks more efficiently.\r\n2. **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS) Workflows:** Investigate whether alternative version control systems or workflows (like Git submodules or subtree merging) could facilitate managing multiple forks.\r\n3. **Inter-Agent Communication Protocol:** If AI-driven code synchronization is a long-term goal, develop a protocol or language for communication between agents managing different forks.\r\n4. **Federated Learning for Agents:**  Explore the potential of federated learning techniques, allowing agents in different forks to collaboratively train and improve shared models without directly exchanging sensitive data.\r\n\r\n**Acceptance Criteria:**\r\n\r\n* A community-driven plan is established and documented for managing divergence across the Eliza ecosystem.\r\n* The plan includes specific steps for facilitating collaboration, streamlining merging, maximizing code reuse, and maintaining core Eliza stability.\r\n* The plan is actively communicated and promoted within the Eliza community.\r\n* Tools and resources (fork registry, communication channels, shared test suite) are created to support the plan's implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis ticket expands the scope to address the broader challenge of managing multiple forks within the Eliza ecosystem. The key shift is towards a community-driven approach, emphasizing collaboration, knowledge sharing, and the development of shared resources and standards.

As part of this mission, I integrated the AI Agent functionality and selected the Eliza framework for managing agent-related tasks. \r\n\r\nWhile configuring the Twitter client and successfully logging into my account, I noticed an issue in the runtime logs: the message `[\"\u25ce Next tweet scheduled in 128 minutes\"]` appeared twice. This indicates that `generateNewTweetLoop` was called twice, resulting in two independent tweet scheduling loops being initialized.\r\n\r\nThe issue occurs because the `start` method in `/packages/client-twitter/src/post.ts` calls `generateNewTweetLoop` twice\u2014once at line 174 and again at line 190\u2014without any conditional checks to prevent multiple timers.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Add the following code to the relevant `character.json` file:\r\n\r\n   ```\r\n   \"clients\": [\"twitter\"]\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Configure the Twitter-related parameters in the `.env` file, and set `POST_IMMEDIATELY=true` to enable immediate tweet posting.\r\n\r\n3. Start the model service.\r\n\r\n4.

As a result, the selected API key could be incorrect (e.g., returning and using a key from FAL instead key from Venice).\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. Set imageModelProvider to VENICE in the character configuration.\r\n2. Provide both FAL_API_KEY and VENICE_API_KEY in .env(or any other relevant key combination).\r\n3.

The inconsistency leads to broken response generation when a JSON-defined `twitterShouldRespondTemplate` is present.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1. **Create a character JSON file** (e.g., `adam.character.json`) that includes:\r\n    ```json\r\n    {\r\n        \"name\": \"your-character-name\",\r\n        \"clients\": [\"telegram\", \"twitter\"],\r\n        \"modelProvider\": \"openai\",\r\n        \"settings\": {\r\n            \"secrets\": {\r\n                \"TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN\": \"your_telegram_bot_token\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_USERNAME\": \"user\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_EMAIL\": \"email@proton.me\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_PASSWORD\": \"your_twitter_password\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_COOKIES\": \"[{\\\"key\\\":\\\"auth_token\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"your_auth_token\\\",\\\"domain\\\":\\\".twitter.com\\\"}, {\\\"key\\\":\\\"ct0\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"your_ct0_value\\\",\\\"domain\\\":\\\".twitter.com\\\"}, {\\\"key\\\":\\\"guest_id\\\",\\\"value\\\":\\\"v1%3A173451270913595996\\\",\\\"domain\\\":\\\".twitter.com\\\"}]\",\r\n                \"TWITTER_TARGET_USERS\": \"user1,user2\"\r\n            }\r\n        },\r\n        \"plugins\": [\r\n            \"@ai16z/plugin-your-custom-plugin\"\r\n        ],\r\n        \"templates\": {\r\n            \"twitterPostTemplate\": \"# Areas of Expertise\\n{{knowledge}}\\n\\n# About {{agentName}} (@{{twitterUserName}}):\\n{{bio}}\\n{{lore}}\\n{{topics}}\\n\\n{{providers}}\\n\\n{{characterPostExamples}}\\n\\n{{postDirections}}\\n\\n# Task: Generate a post in the voice and style and perspective of {{agentName}} @{{twitterUserName}}.\\nWrite a 1-3 sentence post that is {{adjective}} about {{topic}} (without mentioning {{topic}} directly), from the perspective of {{agentName}}.

The error occurs because the `attachments` property in the `Content` interface expects an array of `Media` type objects, but the code was only providing a subset of the required properties.\r\n\r\n**Error message:**\r\n\r\n```\r\nType '{ text: string; }[]' is not assignable to type 'Media[]'.\r\nType '{ text: string; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Media': id, url, title, source, description\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### To Reproduce\r\n\r\n1. Use the Slack client implementation.\r\n2. Try to create a message content with attachments.\r\n3. The code attempts to create an attachment with only the `text` property:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nattachments: attachmentContent ? [{ text: attachmentContent }] : undefined\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Expected Behavior\r\n\r\nThe code should properly implement the `Media` type interface by providing all required properties:\r\n\r\n- `id` (string)\r\n- `url` (string)\r\n- `title` (string)\r\n- `source` (string)\r\n- `description` (string)\r\n- `text` (string)\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\nUpdate the attachment creation to include all required `Media` type properties:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nattachments: attachmentContent\r\n    ? [{\r\n        id: stringToUuid(`${event.ts}-attachment`),\r\n        url: '',  // Since this is text content, no URL is needed\r\n        title: 'Text Attachment',\r\n        source: 'slack',\r\n        description: 'Text content from Slack message',\r\n        text: attachmentContent\r\n    }]\r\n    : undefined,\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Additional Context\r\n\r\nThis issue affects the Slack client's message handling functionality in the `packages/client-slack/src/messages.ts` file.

For example, grok image generation API is not publicly available yet, so when asking my character to generate an image, it defaulted to openAI but that code was not set. It is not clear to developers that this is possible (the image gen using a different fallback than the base LLM). In the case where the image model is provided but does not work, it will assume the underlying access token is openAI, and will use groks token. I think this will extend to all other models where the image model API is not aligned with this `core/generation` file. \r\n\r\nI have added some logging and a bit of logic to improve this and will take ownership of integrating grok image gen when it becomes publicly available, I am following along development in the xAI discord. \r\n\r\nCurrently seeking repo permissions to submit the PR for the enhancement to `packages/core/src/generation` and to add grok image gen capability when it becomes available. \r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nSet character model to grok and ask it to generate an image, user will receive error message pointing to openAI env keys not being set. \r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nUser is informed that the image does not exist or will not match the base model, and that it will default to OPENAI\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n<img width=\"785\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-03 at 3 01 19\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9110b36-391d-4fb6-8012-e81fa4e7a8c9\" />\r\n<img width=\"347\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-03 at 3 01 46\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e522d338-1b16-49d4-9a0e-78e547101f9a\" />\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n", "CLOSED", 0, "simistern", "2025-01-03T20:02:31Z", "2025-01-06T08:07:58Z", "2025-01-06T08:07:58Z", "elizaos/eliza", "2025-04-14 21:51:03"]

For instance, the variable `POST_IMMEDIATELY` uses the string \"NO\", while a boolean value like `TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE` uses `false`. This inconsistency could lead to parsing issues and is prone to human error. \r\n\r\nTo Reproduce\r\n1. Open the `.env` file. 2. Observe that `POST_IMMEDIATELY=NO` is used instead of the expected `false`. \r\n\r\nExpected behavior\r\n Boolean variables should consistently use `true` or `false`, and all string-based boolean values such as `POST_IMMEDIATELY` should use `true`/`false` instead of `\"YES\"`/`\"NO\"`. \r\n\r\nAdditional context\r\n This change will standardize boolean values, making the `.env` file easier to parse and reducing the risk of errors. The `parseBooleanFromText` function, declared as `const parseBooleanFromText: (text: string) => boolean;`, can be used outside the `.env` context to ensure boolean parsing is consistent across the codebase. \r\n\r\nGuidelines for .env values\r\n\r\n1. **Boolean values**: Always use `true` or `false` (not `\"YES\"` or `\"NO\"`). \r\nExample: ``` TWITTER_SEARCH_ENABLE=true POST_IMMEDIATELY=false ``` \r\n\r\n Adhering to these guidelines will ensure consistency and make it easier for automated scripts to process the `.env` file while reduce  human error.", "CLOSED", 0, "hcaumo", "2024-12-23T06:10:15Z", "2025-01-06T05:12:08Z", "2025-01-06T05:12:08Z", "elizaos/eliza", "2025-04-14 21:51:03"]

The companions on Avatar.One come with unique emotes, roleplay features including Netflix and chill, Cyberpunk, Anime Adventure and more. The characters can make selfies, have extensive memory, have custom emotes including striptease and twerk, 1000's of different clothing, the ability for them to go fully naked and of course NSFW chat is enabled.\r\n\r\nWe would like to contribute a plugin to AI16Z which allows Eliza Agents to have their own Avatar.One character profile. They will have their own \"OnlyFans\" profile page which will include bio, profile image, links etc. \r\n\r\nWe will reward the AI Agents or the creators wallet with tokens based on the amount of chats made with the AI Agent. This will drive an income for the AI Agents. It will of course please some of their fans to have NSFW chat. \r\n\r\nAll of our chats are SSH encrypted and stored only on private databases. All users have the ability to delete their history immediately.\r\n\r\nThe full character profile can be added to Avatar.One and their chat will replicate their characters shared on other channel such as Discord.\r\n\r\nAs many AI Agents do not have their own VRMs we can use a vanilla avatar from our maker with the AI Agents profile image applied on the clothing or background of the virtual room.

Please describe.**\r\n\r\nMany image generation services such as FAL, Stable Diffusion, etc. have \"safety checkers\" that ensure prompts are appropriate.\r\nThese have several problems:\r\n\r\n1. Additional latency: These checks are done via an LLM, which can add unnecessary latency.\r\n2. Unpredictable / incorrect outputs: Since the checks use LLMs, their output can be overly restrictive or random, causing unpredictable behavior.\r\n3. Not necessary: Some use cases don't require the safety checker.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we at [daojones.ai](daojones.ai) ([@DAOJonesPumpAI](x.com/DAOJonesPumpAI) on X.com) have found this is overly restrictive and have written a custom image generation application that disables it.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nWe want to set the FAL configuration for our image requests.\r\nWe need to set `enable_safety_checker` to `false` while also setting `safety_tolerance` to `6` (the most tolerant setting).\r\nSince these options are not uniformly supported by the different APIs, we will just add an \"escape hatch\" configuration `imageSettings.fal`.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n1. Turning safety checker off globally: This would work for our use case but could be a breaking change for other use cases.\r\n2. Adding a global `allowNsfw` flag: This requires reconciling this with other APIs and determining what settings it would correspond to.\r\n3. Adding the `enableSafetyChecker` / `safetyTolerance` flags at the top level of `imageSettings`: this would pollute the global namespace.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n", "CLOSED", 0, "daojonesceo", "2024-12-03T05:31:46Z", "2025-01-09T18:33:35Z", "2025-01-09T18:33:35Z", "elizaos/eliza", "2025-04-14 21:51:03"]

["I_kwDOMT5cIs6l1TRj", 2174, "Add support for custom S3 endpoints in `plugin-node`", "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nThe [`plugin-node`](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/tree/main/packages/plugin-node) gives you an S3-compatible API. However, it assumes you're _using_ AWS S3; it doesn't let you use S3-compatible tooling because the request URL is not configurable. \r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nWe should allow the plugin to take an additional (optional) env var called `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT`, which if set, will use the URL for bucket operations. The `plugin-node` only needs a small change [here](https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/ea9d1c02291dea26b25c815be30db5c91e6ceb21/packages/plugin-node/src/services/awsS3.ts#L60) to handle the URL. If it's set, use it; else, use AWS\u2014and this ensures the setup is backward compatible:\r\n```ts\r\nconst clientConfig: S3ClientConfig = {\r\n    region: AWS_REGION,\r\n    credentials: {\r\n        accessKeyId: AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID,\r\n        secretAccessKey: AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY,\r\n    },\r\n};\r\nif (AWS_S3_ENDPOINT) {\r\n    clientConfig.endpoint = AWS_S3_ENDPOINT;\r\n    clientConfig.forcePathStyle = true;\r\n}\r\n\r\nthis.s3Client = new S3Client(clientConfig);\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nIf you're using non-AWS tooling that has an S3-compatible API, you **must** have the ability to customize this URL. There's no alternative. Without this feature, you'll get an error like this when, e.g., calling `uploadFile` against a local S3 service:\r\n```\r\nThe AWS Access Key Id you provided does not exist in our records.\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nYou can test this pattern against [something like MinIO](https://min.io/docs/minio/linux/index.html). Run a local MinIO server, set the env var `AWS_S3_ENDPOINT` in your Eliza setup, and then upload a file. \r\n\r\nOutside of the scope of this issue, it'd be nice if the S3 plugin had additional features for the following. These would be useful for additional agent memory or storage options.\r\n- Creating buckets\r\n- Listing buckets\r\n- Querying buckets\r\n- Getting / downloading objects\r\n\r\nIf these additional features are desirable, I can open a separate issue for adding new `plugin-node` S3 methods.", "CLOSED", 0, "dtbuchholz", "2025-01-12T00:50:00Z", "2025-01-23T04:52:26Z", "2025-01-23T04:52:26Z", "elizaos/eliza", "2025-04-14 21:51:12"]

The testing implementation is expected to be divided into two main components:\n1. Image Analysis Testing (sn34.ts):\n    * Tests should be written to validate image URL processing and API credential handling\n    * Action properties validation is expected to be implemented\n    * Coverage should include both\u00a0analyzeImage\u00a0and\u00a0analysisHistory\u00a0actions\n    * Mock implementations should be created for external API calls\n2. Fact Evaluator Testing (fact.ts):\n    * Validation logic should be thoroughly tested\n    * Evaluator properties verification is expected to be implemented\n    * Fact extraction functionality should be tested with various input scenarios\n    * Memory management operations should be properly mocked\nThe implementation should utilize vitest as the testing framework, and all tests should be organized in a\u00a0__tests__\u00a0directory structure. A vitest configuration file should be created to ensure proper test environment setup. The test coverage is expected to achieve a high percentage, focusing on both successful scenarios and error handling cases.\nDependencies should be properly mocked to ensure isolated testing, and the testing structure should follow the established patterns used in other plugins within the ecosystem. This approach is expected to enhance code reliability and make future maintenance more manageable.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n<!-- A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered. -->\n\n**Additional context**\n\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\n", "CLOSED", 0, "ai16z-demirix", "2025-01-30T21:17:15Z", "2025-01-31T19:44:00Z", "2025-01-31T19:44:00Z", "elizaos/eliza", "2025-04-14 21:51:24"]

["I_kwDOMT5cIs6lg-vg", 2050, "fix: prevent forged public keys from using valid attestations as proof to deceive users", "When a user wants to verify a log's signature using a public key, they first need to ensure that the public key was indeed generated within the TEE. This requires the user to verify the correctness of the remote attestation. However, users obtain the remote attestation by accessing the `/verifiable/attestation` endpoint, which calls the `generateAttestation` function. This function doesn't validate the agent ID and public key from the user's request, but instead directly generates a remote attestation. This doesn't prove that the public key corresponds to a private key generated within the TEE.\r\nAssuming TLS communication is established between the user and Eliza, I propose two correct approaches:\r\n\r\nThe user provides the agent_id, subject, and publicKey required for private key generation to the `generateAttestation` function. Within this function, a key pair is generated using deriveKey, and the resulting public key is compared with the publicKey parameter. If they match, an attestation report should be generated with the publicKey included in the report.\r\nSince Eliza has already stored the publicKey in the SQLite database during initial registerAgent, if we can ensure that the SQLite database content is encrypted and cannot be tampered with by software outside the TEE, the `generateAttestation` function can directly read the publicKey from the database using the agent_id, subject, and keypath. It then compares this with the publicKey in the user's request, and if they match, generates an attestation report.\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation, if someone sends a log to a user with a signature generated by a private key from outside the TEE, and provides this forged public key to the user, when the user requests an attestation through the `/verifiable/attestation` endpoint with the agent_id and corresponding public key, Eliza running in the TEE will directly send a valid attestation to the user. This allows users to be deceived\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @lightning-li in https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/1369#discussion_r1908145251_\r\n            ", "CLOSED", 0, "HashWarlock", "2025-01-09T05:45:07Z", "2025-02-09T07:22:11Z", "2025-02-09T07:22:10Z", "elizaos/eliza", "2025-04-14 21:51:29"]

Run `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile` followed by `pnpm build` to initialize.\n\n2. **Which Node.js version should I use?**\n   - Use **Node.js version 23.3.0** for optimal compatibility. Install using `nvm install 23.3.0` and `nvm use 23.3.0`.\n\n3. **How do I fix installation errors?**\n   - Ensure Node.js version 23.3.0, run `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile`, clean cache with `pnpm clean`, and rebuild with `pnpm build`. For Windows, use **WSL2**.\n\n4. **What are the minimum system requirements?**\n   - Basic setup requires Node.js, 2-4GB RAM, and necessary API keys. Can run locally or on cloud services.\n\n---\n\n### **Deployment**\n1. **How do I deploy Eliza in production/cloud?**\n   - Use **Docker** for containerization and deploy to cloud services like **DigitalOcean, AWS, or Google Cloud**. For basic setups, an 8GB RAM instance can handle multiple agents (approximately 6 agents).\n\n2. **How do I deploy without a GPU/CUDA?**\n   - Switch the `modelProvider` in your configuration from `LLAMALOCAL` to alternatives like `OPENAI` or use cloud-based options that don\u2019t require local GPU processing.\n\n---\n\n### **Running Multiple Agents**\n1. **How do I run multiple agents simultaneously?**\n   - Use the command:  \n     ```bash\n     pnpm start --characters=\"characters/1.character.json,characters/2.character.json\"\n     ```\n   - Each agent requires additional resources (~2GB RAM).\n\n---\n\n### **Model Configuration**\n1. **How do I configure the model provider and switch between models?**\n   - Set the `modelProvider` in your `character.json` (e.g., `\"anthropic\"`) and configure the corresponding API keys in `.env`. Different models can be used for text generation, image processing, etc.\n\n2. **How do I use local models with Eliza?**\n   - Use **Ollama** for local models. Install Ollama, download the desired model (e.g., `llama3.1`), set `modelProvider` to `\"ollama\"` in the character file, and configure `OLLAMA` settings in `.env`.\n\n3. **How do I make my agent use a cheaper/smaller model?**\n   - Configure `gpt-4o-mini` as your model in `.env` and character settings to minimize costs.\n\n---\n\n### **Twitter Integration**\n1. **How do I set up Twitter/X integration?**\n   - Add Twitter credentials to `.env` and the character file. Enable the automated tag in your Twitter account settings and configure `TWITTER_POLL_INTERVAL` to manage interaction frequency.\n\n2. **How do I prevent my agent from spamming tweets?**\n   - Set `ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=false` in `.env` and adjust `POST_INTERVAL_MIN`, `POST_INTERVAL_MAX`, and `ACTION_INTERVAL` settings to control posting frequency.\n\n3. **Why is my agent not responding to mentions?**\n   - Verify Twitter credentials and ensure target users are properly configured in your character file. Some accounts need manual activity before automation works reliably.\n\n4. **How do I make my agent post images on Twitter?**\n   - Set `IMAGE_GEN=TRUE` in `.env` and configure an image provider like **DALL-E**. Check `agent-twitter-client` documentation for implementation details.\n\n---\n\n### **Agent Memory & Knowledge**\n1. **How do I clear/reset the agent's memory?**\n   - Delete the SQLite database file in the `/data` directory or use `pnpm cleanstart` to reset memory.\n\n2. **How do I add custom knowledge to my agent?**\n   - Use the `knowledge` section in your `character.json` file or implement a custom vector database for larger datasets.\n\n3. **How do I handle the \"Vector dimension mismatch\" error?**\n   - This occurs when switching between embedding models. Clear the database (delete `sqlite.db`) and rebuild with consistent embedding dimensions.\n\n---\n\n### **Plugins & Custom Actions**\n1. **How do I add plugins to my agent?**\n   - Add the plugin name to the `\"plugins\"` array in your `character.json` file (e.g., `\"plugins\": [\"@Elizaos/plugin-name\"]`). Ensure the plugin is installed in your project dependencies.\n\n2. **How do I implement custom actions?**\n   - Create a new plugin with your action logic and register it in your agent's configuration. Watch **Eliza Dev School** videos for detailed guidance.\n\n3. **How do I debug plugin-related issues?**\n   - Check logs for error messages, verify environment variables, and ensure the plugin is properly imported and configured.\n\n---\n\n### **Agent Behavior & Customization**\n1. **How do I make my agent's responses more natural/less repetitive?**\n   - Customize the character's `bio`, `lore`, and `post examples` in the `character.json` file. Adjust interaction settings and consider using different model providers.\n\n2. **How do I make my agent interact in languages other than English?**\n   - Configure the language preferences in your character file's `bio` and `lore` sections, and specify the desired language in the character's configuration.\n\n3. **Why does my agent keep talking to itself?**\n   - Check your character configuration and interaction settings. This usually happens when conversation triggers aren\u2019t properly configured or self-talk limitations aren\u2019t set.\n\n---\n\n### **Troubleshooting**\n1. **Why does my build fail with dependency errors?**\n   - Ensure Node.js version 23+, run `pnpm install --no-frozen-lockfile`, and verify all required dependencies are installed correctly.\n\n2. **How do I fix Twitter login/authentication issues (399 errors, etc.)?**\n   - Enable 2FA on the Twitter account, ensure cookies are set properly, and verify credentials in `.env` or character file secrets. Some users resolved this by manually logging into the account first.\n\n3. **How do I debug issues when my agent isn\u2019t working as expected?**\n   - Check logs for error messages, verify environment variables, and ensure the correct Node.js version. Use `pnpm start:debug` to track execution flow.\n\n---\n\n### **Advanced Configuration**\n1. **How do I set up Supabase/PostgreSQL for agent memory?**\n   - Initialize Supabase with the correct schema and configure the connection in `.env`. Handle pool reconnection errors as needed.\n\n2. **How do I implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)?**\n   - Use `folder2knowledge` to convert documents into knowledge, then use `knowledge2character` to create character files. The agent stores context in its memory system.\n\n3. **How do I handle multi-agent systems and workflow automation?**\n   - Eliza supports multi-agent architectures natively. Configure separate character files for each agent and use proper client configurations to enable inter-agent communication.\n```", "CLOSED", 0, "madjin", "2025-01-31T01:54:21Z", "2025-02-20T20:39:45Z", "2025-02-20T20:39:44Z", "elizaos/eliza", "2025-04-14 21:52:50"]

This could be valuable documentation for other developers.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\nThe Discord client was failing with the following error:\r\n```\r\nError [TokenInvalid]: An invalid token was provided.\r\n    at WebSocketManager.connect (/Users/.../eliza/node_modules/discord.js/src/client/websocket/WebSocketManager.js:136:26)\r\n    at Client.login (/Users/.../eliza/node_modules/discord.js/src/client/Client.js:228:21)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis was happening even though the tokens were correctly set in the `.env` file. The issue was in how the tokens were being resolved from environment variables.\r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nI fixed this by:\r\n\r\n1. Ensuring proper token resolution in `eliza/packages/client-discord/src/index.ts`:\r\n```typescript\r\n// Get the token using runtime's getSecret\r\nconst token = this.character?.settings?.secrets?.DISCORD_API_TOKEN;\r\n\r\n// If it's a variable reference (${...}), resolve it from environment\r\nif (token?.startsWith('${') && token?.endsWith('}')) {\r\n    const envVarName = token.slice(2, -1);\r\n    this.apiToken = process.env[envVarName] || '';\r\n} else {\r\n    this.apiToken = token || '';\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Adding debug logging to track token resolution:\r\n```typescript\r\nelizaLogger.debug('Token resolution debug:', {\r\n    characterName: this.character.name,\r\n    rawToken: token,\r\n    isEnvVar: token?.startsWith('${') && token?.endsWith('}'),\r\n    envVarName: token?.startsWith('${') ? token.slice(2, -1) : null,\r\n    envValue: token?.startsWith('${') ? process.env[token.slice(2, -1)] : null\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Key Points\r\n1. Character files should reference environment variables using `${VAR_NAME}` syntax:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n    \"settings\": {\r\n        \"secrets\": {\r\n            \"DISCORD_API_TOKEN\": \"${DISCORD_API_TOKEN_JULIE}\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. The `.env` file should contain the actual tokens:\r\n```env\r\nDISCORD_API_TOKEN_JULIE=actual_token_here\r\nDISCORD_API_TOKEN_JUAN=actual_token_here\r\n```\r\n(where Julie and Juan are agents names)\r\n\r\n3. The token resolution process:\r\n   - First checks character's settings.secrets\r\n   - If the value is a variable reference (${...}), resolves it from environment\r\n   - Otherwise uses the raw value\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\nTo verify the fix:\r\n1. Ensure tokens are correctly set in `.env`\r\n2. Run the bot with both characters:\r\n```bash\r\npnpm start --characters=\"characters/julie.character.json,characters/juan.character.json\"\r\n```\r\n3. Check debug logs for token resolution process \r\n\r\n## Proposal\r\nI suggest:\r\n1. Adding this documentation to the main repository\r\n2. Possibly including it in the official docs under a \"Troubleshooting\" or \"Configuration\" section\r\n3. Adding debug logs to help other developers diagnose similar issues\r\n\r\nLet me know if you'd like me to create a PR with these changes.

Manual Documentation Phase:\r\n   - Add comprehensive JSDoc comments to all TypeScript files\r\n   - Include documentation for functions, classes, interfaces, and other code blocks\r\n\r\n2. Automation Implementation:\r\n   - Develop an LLM-based automation solution for generating JSDoc comments\r\n   - Integrate the automation into our CI/CD pipeline (like when a PR for a new feat is merged)\r\n   - Create a manual trigger mechanism for the automation process\r\n\r\n**Create a GitHub Actions workflow/AI agent that:**\r\n\r\n1. Automated Documentation Generation:\r\n   - Triggers on demand (via workflow_dispatch) or when specific files change\r\n   - Scans TypeScript files that lack JSDoc documentation\r\n   - Uses an AI service (e.g., OpenAI API) to generate contextually accurate JSDoc comments\r\n   - Maintains existing JSDoc comments and only adds missing ones\r\n\r\n2. Quality Control:\r\n   - Follows our existing JSDoc standards and TypeDoc configuration\r\n   - Validates generated comments for completeness and accuracy\r\n   - Ensures proper documentation of parameters, return types, and function descriptions\r\n\r\n3. Pull Request Management:\r\n   - Creates a new branch for documentation updates\r\n   - Generates a pull request with the changes\r\n   - Adds appropriate labels (e.g., 'documentation', 'automated')\r\n   - Includes a detailed PR description explaining the changes\r\n   - Assigns relevant reviewers\r\n\r\n4.

["I_kwDOMT5cIs6hhhQM", 764, "Epic: Refactoring Eliza's Trading System for Multi-Chain Compatibility", "**Overview:**\r\n\r\nThis epic addresses the need to refactor Eliza's trading system to improve multi-chain compatibility and resolve the current conflict between the Solana plugin (and other individual chain plugins) and Coinbase SDK. The goal is to create a more flexible and extensible architecture that can accommodate various blockchain integrations and trading strategies.\r\n\r\n**Goals:**\r\n\r\n* Eliminate redundancy and inconsistency between the plugins for individual chains and Coinbase SDK.\r\n* Establish a unified trading interface that can be implemented by different blockchain/exchange adapters.\r\n* Implement a centralized data source or normalization layer for price and market data.\r\n* Develop a unified wallet management system for different blockchain/exchange wallets.\r\n* Support diverse trading strategies beyond simple token swaps (e.g., swing trading, day trading).\r\n* Ensure scalability and maintainability of the trading system as new integrations are added.\r\n\r\n**Decision Points:**\r\n\r\n* **DP1: Coinbase SDK Focus vs. Multi-SDK Support:**\r\n    * **Option A: Prioritize Coinbase SDK:** Focus primarily on the Coinbase SDK and contribute back to its development to enhance its functionality and multi-chain support.  This would involve working closely with the Coinbase team and aligning development efforts.\r\n    * **Option B: Create a Training Module/Adapter System:** Develop a training module or adapter system that allows Eliza to seamlessly integrate with different SDKs (Coinbase, Solana Web3.js, etc.). This would provide greater flexibility but require more upfront development effort.  This approach requires designing abstract interfaces for trading, data retrieval, and wallet management.\r\n    * **Option C: Hybrid Approach:**  Start with a focus on the Coinbase SDK for its existing multi-chain support, but design the system with the future flexibility to add other SDKs via an adapter pattern.  This would balance immediate needs with long-term extensibility.\r\n\r\n* **DP2: Centralized vs. Decentralized Data Management:**\r\n    * **Option A: Centralized Data Source:** Choose a single, reliable data provider for price and market data.  This simplifies data management but creates a single point of failure.\r\n    * **Option B: Decentralized Data Aggregation:**  Aggregate data from multiple sources (Coinbase, Jupiter, Birdeye, etc.) and implement a normalization layer to handle discrepancies and ensure data consistency. This approach is more robust but increases complexity.\r\n\r\n* **DP3: Unified Wallet Management Strategy:**\r\n    * **Option A: Abstract Wallet Interface:**  Develop an abstract wallet interface that can be implemented by different wallet providers (Solana, Coinbase, etc.).  This allows for flexibility in wallet selection but requires careful design.\r\n    * **Option B:  Custom Wallet Management Service:** Create a custom wallet management service within Eliza that interacts directly with different wallet APIs.  This provides more control but increases development effort.\r\n\r\n* **DP4: Scope of Trading Strategies:**\r\n    * **Option A:  Focus on Long-Term Holding:** Initially, limit support to long-term buy-and-hold strategies, simplifying the trust engine and trade management.\r\n    * **Option B:  Support Arbitrary Trading:** Implement support for a wider range of trading strategies (swing trading, day trading, etc.) from the outset.  This increases complexity but provides greater flexibility.\r\n\r\n**Proposed Sub-Tickets (Initial List - To be refined):**\r\n\r\n* **ST1: Design Abstract Trading Interface:** Design a unified trading interface that can be implemented by different blockchain/exchange adapters.\r\n* **ST2: Implement Coinbase Adapter:** Create a Coinbase adapter that implements the abstract trading interface, handling trade execution, data retrieval, and wallet management.\r\n* **ST3: Implement Solana Adapter:** Create a Solana adapter that implements the abstract trading interface.\r\n* **ST4: Develop Data Normalization Layer (if needed):** If using multiple data sources, create a data normalization layer to ensure data consistency.\r\n* **ST5: Implement Unified Wallet Management System:**  Develop a unified wallet management system that supports multiple blockchain/exchange wallets.\r\n* **ST6: Implement Position Tracking:**  Create a system for tracking open positions and trade history.\r\n* **ST7: Enhance Trust Engine for Arbitrary Trading:** Modify the trust engine to support different trade types, timeframes, and performance metrics.\r\n* **ST8: Develop Backtesting Framework:** Implement a backtesting framework for evaluating trading strategies.\r\n* **ST9: Implement Automated Trading Engine:** Develop an automated trading engine.\r\n* **ST10: Testing and Validation:**  Develop a comprehensive test suite for the refactored trading system, covering different adapters, data sources, and trading scenarios.\r\n* **ST11: Documentation and Examples:**  Update the documentation to reflect the changes in the trading system architecture and provide examples of using different adapters and strategies.\r\n\r\n**Next Steps:**\r\n\r\n* Conduct thorough research and analysis to inform decisions on each decision point.\r\n* Prioritize sub-tickets based on chosen architecture and strategic goals.\r\n* Assign sub-tickets to developers and create a development roadmap.\r\n* Regularly review progress and update this epic ticket accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis epic provides a roadmap for refactoring Eliza's trading system to achieve multi-chain compatibility and support more advanced trading strategies.

Place Order\n   - Market/Limit orders\n   - Long/Short positions\n   - Support for all perpetual markets (BTC-USD-PERP, ETH-USD-PERP, etc.)\n   - Size and price specifications\n   - Example commands:\n     - \"Long 0.1 ETH\"\n     - \"Short 0.5 BTC at 96000\"\n     - \"Buy 1000 USDC worth of ETH\"\n     - \"Sell 0.2 ETH at 5000\"\n\n2. Cancel Order\n   - Cancel specific orders by ID\n   - Example commands:\n     - \"Cancel order 123456789\"\n     - \"Remove order xyz789\"\n\nProviders:\n1. Authentication\n   - JWT token management\n   - StarkNet account integration\n   - Secure private key handling\n\n2. Market Data\n   - BBO (Best Bid/Offer) provider\n   - Available markets provider\n   - Open orders provider\n   - Open positions provider\n   - Account balance provider\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n- Direct integration with Paradex API without Eliza\n- Using existing trading bots\n- Manual trading through Paradex UI\n\nThese alternatives lack the natural language processing capabilities and extensibility that Eliza provides.\n\n**Additional context**\n- Integration will be built on top of Paradex's v1 API\n- Will require secure environment variable management for private keys and API credentials\n- Plugin will follow Eliza's provider/action architecture pattern\n- All trading functions will include proper error handling and logging", "CLOSED", 0, "julienbrs", "2025-02-21T09:27:23Z", "2025-03-08T01:15:16Z", "2025-03-08T01:15:16Z", "elizaos/eliza", "2025-04-14 21:54:46"]

It'd be my first open-source contribution!\n\n**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\n\nThe TwitterPostClient's dry run mode currently only logs tweet content via elizaLogger.info() without returning the data. This makes it difficult to programmatically access draft tweets, requiring workarounds like runtime method overriding. Specifically, applications need to override the info logger at runtime to capture the draft tweet content, which is brittle and hard to maintain.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nModify the generateNewTweet() method to return a structured result object while maintaining existing logging behavior:\n\n```typescript\ninterface TweetGenerationResult {\n  success: boolean;\n  dryRun?: boolean;\n  tweet?: string;\n  error?: string;\n}\n```\n\nThis would allow applications to programmatically access draft tweets while maintaining backwards compatibility through continued logging.\n\n`isDryRun`'s current `return` in `main`: https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/81a35281b93d5e8ca0745e9d13a1943e9a90681b/packages/client-twitter/src/post.ts#L605-L610\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n- Runtime method overriding (current workaround)\n- Creating a separate dryRun method\n- Using events to emit draft tweets\n\nThe structured return object provides the cleanest solution with the least impact on existing code.\n\nAgain, you'd find me happy to implement this change.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nThis enhancement would improve the developer experience when building applications on top of the client-twitter package. The current implementation forces developers to use workarounds that make code harder to maintain and test.\n\nRelated file: packages/client-twitter/src/post.ts", "CLOSED", 0, "spencerf2", "2025-02-11T16:23:54Z", "2025-03-08T01:17:36Z", "2025-03-08T01:17:35Z", "elizaos/eliza", "2025-04-14 21:54:46"]

The API logs indicate that the bot only makes two calls per response (one for the medium model and one for the large model). However, due to `DEFAULT_MAX_TWEET_LENGTH`, the generated response is split into multiple tweets to fit within the 280-character limit.  \n\nThis is usually a minor compliance issue, but in some cases, the agent detects these split responses as incomplete sentences and attempts to generate additional replies repeatedly. As a result, the API sometimes makes **4 to 6 calls instead of 2**, leading to excessive LLM token usage and increased costs.  \n\n**Steps to Reproduce**  \n1. Enable the bot to reply to follower tweets.  \n2. Observe API logs, which show only two calls being made.  \n3. Due to `DEFAULT_MAX_TWEET_LENGTH`, the reply is split into multiple tweets.  \n4. In some cases, the agent perceives the split content as incomplete and generates additional responses.  \n5. The bot may end up making **4\u20136 API calls per tweet**, leading to unnecessary token consumption.  \n\n**Expected Behavior**  \n- The bot should generate only **one** response per tweet and appropriately split it if needed, without triggering unnecessary additional responses.  \n\n**Actual Behavior**  \n- The bot sometimes misinterprets split responses as incomplete and keeps generating additional replies, leading to multiple API calls (4\u20136 instead of 2).  \n\n**Impact**  \n- **High token usage**, leading to increased API costs.  \n- **Potential rate limits or compliance issues** with excessive replies to a single tweet.  \n\n**Temporary Fixes**  \n- set `DEFAULT_MAX_TWEET_LENGTH` to much higher number(like 500)\n\nI think this is mainly from `interation.ts` and `continue.ts`.\n\n**Screenshots**\n\n<img width=\"300\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b70be945-2446-4d4e-aa37-d13213b2cbb6\" />\n\n", "CLOSED", 0, "naiveai-dev", "2025-02-09T05:35:03Z", "2025-03-08T03:19:01Z", "2025-03-08T03:19:00Z", "elizaos/eliza", "2025-04-14 21:54:46"]

Please describe.**\n\nCurrently, the agent behavior is too predictable, making it easily detectable by external users and Twitter's moderation system. This can lead to suspicion, reduced engagement, or even temporary shadowbans due to excessive, unnatural activity patterns.\n\nIn a previous version, the agent adhered to a \"working hours\" schedule, remaining inactive at night. This approach not only helped avoid shadowbans but also improved efficiency by focusing engagement during peak hours. However, in its current form, the agent runs continuously, posting and commenting strictly according to predefined .env parameters, making it look artificial and increasing the risk of detection.\n\nAdditionally, engagement with newer posts significantly boosts visibility and interactions. Therefore, ensuring that the bot prioritizes fresh posts\u2014those published within the last hour\u2014would optimize its impact.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\n- Configurable Active Hours: Introduce an option in the settings to define specific working hours, e.g., 10:00 - 21:00 UTC. This would make the agent behavior more human-like and reduce the risk of being flagged by Twitter\u2019s algorithms.\n\n- Post Freshness Limit: Add a setting to specify the maximum age of posts the bot engages with. For instance, allowing interactions only with posts published within the last 5 to 50 minutes. This ensures the agent remains relevant by engaging with fresh content, thereby maximizing visibility and interaction rates.\n\n- Randomized Activity Patterns: Instead of rigid time frames, allow the bot to have slight variations in its posting schedule, mimicking human-like inconsistencies. This could include random delays between actions and periodic \"idle\" times.\n\n- Engagement-Based Adaptation: Implement a dynamic adjustment mechanism where the bot increases or decreases its activity based on engagement metrics. For example, if a certain time window yields higher interactions, the bot could prioritize those hours automatically.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n- Using machine learning to analyze peak engagement times and adjust activity accordingly.\n\n- Introducing a \"cooldown\" system where the bot temporarily slows down if engagement drops too quickly, preventing detection.\n\n\n**Additional context**\n\nThese enhancements would make the bot appear more organic, reducing the risk of detection and optimizing engagement. By mimicking natural behavior, the bot could sustain long-term growth without triggering Twitter\u2019s moderation systems.

But today, the situation is that in order to even make the first steps with eliza, there's a little barrier to entry in the form of cloning this massive repo, fetching all of the dependencies from every plugin ever integrated, building all the plugins just to be able to see a SBF example that fetches Solana balances. This situation not only hinders the devex but the disk footprint is also huge (9.2GB for the `node_modules/` and 1.8GB for the built plugins).\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nIt would be great if instead of cloning the repo with all its plugins and all their dependencies eliza would be installed via a dedicated CLI with commands like\n\n```sh\n# Installs the minimal core elements \n$ eliza init [--template template-name]\n```\n\nthen plugins could be installed on-demand with\n\n```sh\n# Installs the plugin and its dependencies\n$ eliza add plugin-name\n```\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nAn alternative to this approach today would be to make forks of the repo where everything that isn't used would be deleted.

Please describe.**  \n\nCurrently, elizaOS does not support generating images via [Ideogram](https://ideogram.ai). Many users might prefer Ideogram over other AI image-generation tools due to its unique capabilities, such as better text rendering and a different artistic approach. Without an Ideogram plugin, users have to manually generate images outside of elizaOS, disrupting their workflow.  \n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**  \n\nA new plugin that integrates Ideogram into elizaOS, allowing users to generate images directly within the system. The plugin should provide an easy-to-use interface for specifying prompts, selecting styles, and handling generated images seamlessly. Ideally, it would support API-based integration (if available) or an alternative method to interact with Ideogram efficiently.  \n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**  \n\n- Using existing AI image-generation plugins within elizaOS, but they do not provide the same features as Ideogram.  \n- Manually generating images via Ideogram's website, but this disrupts the workflow and requires extra steps.  \n\n**Additional context**  \n\n- Ideogram is gaining popularity due to its ability to generate images with embedded text more effectively than other AI tools.  \n- If Ideogram has an API, integrating it into elizaOS could improve accessibility for users who frequently work with AI-generated images.

For example, generateShouldRespond, generateTrueOrFalse, generateTextArray, generateObject, generateObjectArray, generateMessageResponse, generateImage, generateCaption should all be registered functions that are handled per-plugin. **trimTokens should also be handled per-plugin.** so that tiktoken etc can be imported from the plugin.\n\nTikToken and Auto tokenizer deps should be removed from core and moved into plugin", "CLOSED", 0, "lalalune", "2025-01-27T18:35:59Z", "2025-03-08T01:16:13Z", "2025-03-08T01:16:13Z", "elizaos/eliza", "2025-04-14 21:54:46"]

It should be possible to configure the agents to let it know which accounts are watch only vs which account should be always replied, or something in between to reply only if adds value.\n\nHere is the code from `client-twitter/src/interactions.ts` file for function `twitterShouldRespondTemplate`.

Please describe.**\n\nCurrently, there is no streamlined or standardized way for an ElizaOS agent deployed on Virtuals as a token to log its actions or report its activities to the Virtuals Terminal. This lack of integration creates a gap in transparency and monitoring, making it difficult to track agent behavior, analyze interactions, and ensure alignment with operational or ethical guidelines.\n\nFor example, actions such as user interactions, data processing, or decision-making events are not being logged in the Virtuals Terminal, resulting in limited visibility and accountability for deployed agents.\n\n---\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nI propose the development of a dedicated plugin or module that seamlessly integrates with the [Virtuals Terminal API](https://whitepaper.virtuals.io/developer-documents/terminal-api) to report all agent actions and events. \n\nThe plugin/module should:\n1. **Log Key Actions:** Automatically capture and send details of all actions performed by the agent, such as user interactions, system updates, or triggered events.\n2. **Token-Based Authentication:** Use the Virtuals Terminal API key to ensure secure and authenticated communication between the agent and the Terminal.\n3. **Customizable Reporting:** Allow configuration of which actions to log and report to minimize unnecessary data flow and enhance relevance.\n4. **Real-Time Logging:** Enable near real-time reporting of activities to provide immediate visibility into agent behavior.\n5. **Error Handling:** Include mechanisms for handling API errors or downtime gracefully, ensuring that logs are not lost during connectivity issues.\n\n---\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n1. **Manual Logging:** Setting up a custom logging system to track agent actions.

I propose that the agent should be always \"listening\" while others speak, so that the agent can already work on a prompt based on the context of the conversation and relevant knowledge to respond as soon as the others finish speaking or even jump into conversations if needed.\n\n2. Allow the human speaker to use keywords such as stop, halt or anything else to the same effect to essentially tell the agentruntime to stop streaming the audio chunks from elevenlabs and start listening again straightaway.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nI took a first stab at my proposed solutions but didn't have any luck so far.\n\nSome issues I faced\n- I was not able to collect audio data, convert at fixed intervals and temporarily store as well as checking against RAG to get relevance scores which should be the trigger to send the prompt and generate response.\n- The main issue with trying to get the agent to pick out \"stop\" and related keywords was that the audio capture came from both the human speaker and the agent which makes it difficult to recognise the stop request.\n\n\n\n\n**Some failed attempts**\n\n**Listen, search RAG and respond**\n\n```typescript\nprivate async addToQueue(userId: string, text: string) {\n    this.messageQueue.push({\n        userId,\n        text,\n        timestamp: Date.now(),\n        isProcessed: false\n    });\n\n    if (!this.isProcessingQueue) {\n        await this.processQueue();\n    }\n}\n\nprivate async processQueue() {\n    if (this.isProcessingQueue) return;\n    this.isProcessingQueue = true;\n\n    try {\n        // Wait for transcription accumulation window\n        await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, this.transcriptionAccumulationTimeMs));\n\n        while (this.messageQueue.length > 0) {\n            // Process all messages that arrived within the last window\n            const now = Date.now();\n            const windowStart = now - this.transcriptionAccumulationTimeMs;\n            const messagesInWindow = this.messageQueue\n                .filter(item => !item.isProcessed && item.timestamp >= windowStart);\n\n            if (messagesInWindow.length === 0) break;\n\n            // Combine all messages in the window\n            const combinedText = messagesInWindow\n                .map(item => item.text)\n                .join(\" \")\n                .trim();\n\n            if (combinedText.length > 0) {\n                const relevanceScore = await this.checkRelevance(combinedText);\n                elizaLogger.info(`[SttTtsPlugin] Processing combined messages: \"${combinedText}\", Score: ${relevanceScore}`);\n\n                if (relevanceScore > 0.3) {\n                    // Check if anyone is currently speaking\n                    const anyActiveSpeakers = Array.from(this.speakerStates.values())\n                        .some(state => state.isSpeaking);\n\n                    if (!anyActiveSpeakers) {\n                        await this.generateAndSpeakResponse(combinedText);\n                        // Mark all processed messages\n                        messagesInWindow.forEach(item => item.isProcessed = true);\n                        // Remove processed messages from queue\n                        this.messageQueue = this.messageQueue.filter(item => !item.isProcessed);\n                        break;\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n\n            // Mark messages as processed\n            messagesInWindow.forEach(item => item.isProcessed = true);\n            // Clean up processed messages\n            this.messageQueue = this.messageQueue.filter(item => !item.isProcessed);\n\n            // Brief pause before next iteration\n            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 300));\n        }\n    } finally {\n        this.isProcessingQueue = false;\n    }\n}\n\nprivate async checkRelevance(text: string): Promise<number> {\n    try {\n        elizaLogger.info(\"[SttTtsPlugin] Checking relevance for text:\", {\n            text,\n            length: text.length\n        });\n\n        // Respond to very short messages if they might be addressing the agent\n        if (text.length < 5) {\n            // Check if it sounds like \"hey\", \"hi\", \"yo\" etc\n            if (/^(hey|hi|yo|oh|um|uh|you|byte)\\b/i.test(text)) {\n                elizaLogger.info(\"[SttTtsPlugin] Detected greeting/acknowledgment:\", text);\n                return 0.7;

["I_kwDOMT5cIs6t65cr", 3914, "Usage of typebox for safety", "Feature Request: Adopt TypeBox for Type Safety in elizaos/eliza\nIs your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.\nYes, this feature request addresses the challenge of ensuring data integrity when handling dynamic inputs in elizaos/eliza, such as API responses, user inputs, or LLM-generated JSON. Without proper validation, malformed data can lead to runtime errors, inconsistent behavior, or bugs that are hard to debug. For example, if eliza processes a JSON response expecting a confidence field as a number between 0 and 1, but receives a string or out-of-range value, it could cause unexpected failures or incorrect logic.\nDescribe the solution you'd like\nI propose integrating TypeBox, a lightweight TypeScript library, to introduce type safety into eliza. TypeBox combines JSON schema validation with TypeScript type inference, providing both compile-time and runtime safety. Here\u2019s how it could work:\nDefine Schemas: Create TypeBox schemas for key data structures, such as API responses:\ntypescript\n\nimport { Type, Static } from '@sinclair/typebox';\n\nconst ElizaResponseSchema = Type.Object({\n  intent: Type.String(),\n  confidence: Type.Number({ minimum: 0, maximum: 1 }),\n  entities: Type.Array(Type.String())\n});\n\ntype ElizaResponse = Static<typeof ElizaResponseSchema>;\n\nValidate Data: Use TypeBox to validate incoming data at runtime:\ntypescript\n\nfunction validateElizaResponse(json: unknown): ElizaResponse {\n  const result = ElizaResponseSchema.safeParse(json);\n  if (!result.success) throw new Error(`Validation failed: ${result.error.message}`);\n  return result.data;\n}\n\nIntegrate: Apply this to a small component (e.g., API response parsing) to start, ensuring data integrity without disrupting existing workflows.\n\nThis solution ensures eliza processes data safely, reducing errors and improving reliability.\nDescribe alternatives you've considered  \nZod: Another popular schema validation library for TypeScript. While Zod offers similar features (type inference, runtime validation), it has a slightly larger footprint and a different syntax that might feel less JSON Schema-like compared to TypeBox. TypeBox\u2019s alignment with JSON Schema standards makes it more interoperable with existing systems.\n\nManual Type Guards: Writing custom type guards in TypeScript (e.g., isElizaResponse functions) can provide some safety but lacks the robustness of schema-based validation and doesn\u2019t scale well for complex data structures.\n\nNo Validation: Continuing without validation risks runtime errors, especially as eliza scales to handle more dynamic data sources, which could degrade user experience or system stability.\n\nAdditional Context\nTypeBox is lightweight (minimal overhead), widely used, and well-documented, making it an easy adoption for the Eliza team. It provides immediate benefits\u2014error prevention, improved developer productivity through TypeScript integration, and a foundation for scaling to more advanced validation or formal methods in the future. Starting with a small integration allows the team to evaluate its impact with minimal risk, paving the way for broader adoption across elizaos/eliza.\n\n", "CLOSED", 0, "jmikedupont2", "2025-03-13T17:15:46Z", "2025-03-20T02:26:21Z", "2025-03-20T02:26:21Z", "elizaos/eliza", "2025-04-14 21:55:06"]

This occurs when configured to use a custom character (flappy.character.json) located in a root characters/ directory, with the goal of using the Anthropic model provider (@elizaos/plugin-anthropic) and the Twitter client (@elizaos/plugin-twitter) with auto-interactions enabled.\nThe logs show successful character loading, correct plugin identification (@elizaos/plugin-twitter, @elizaos/plugin-anthropic), selection of \"anthropic\" as the model provider, database connection, and REST API binding. However, the process never proceeds to the expected Twitter client initialization logs (Creating default Twitter client..., Successfully logged in., Start Hanldeling Twitter Timeline, etc.) or any Anthropic-related activity. The process does not crash or exit; it simply stalls.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n(Based on troubleshooting sequence followed)\nClean VPS environment.\nInstall prerequisites: Node v23.11.0 (via NVM), pnpm v9.15.0, git, build-essential.\nClone the main eliza monorepo: git clone https://github.com/elizaos/eliza.git && cd eliza.\nCheck out the latest stable tag: git checkout $(git describe --tags --abbrev=0).\nCreate and configure ~/eliza/.env with valid Twitter API credentials (Key, Secret, Access Token, Secret) and a valid Anthropic API Key. Ensure ENABLE_TWITTER_POST_GENERATION=true and ENABLE_ACTION_PROCESSING=true. Ensure conflicting AI providers (USE_LOCAL_AI, USE_OLLAMA_TEXT_MODELS, OPENAI_API_KEY, etc.) are explicitly set to false or commented out.\nCreate a ~/eliza/characters/ directory.\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.character.json configured with \"clients\": [\"twitter\"], \"plugins\": [\"@elizaos/plugin-twitter\", \"@elizaos/plugin-anthropic\"], \"modelProvider\": \"anthropic\", and a specific \"model\": \"claude-3-haiku-20240307\". Include Twitter interaction settings under settings.twitter.\nCreate ~/eliza/characters/flappy.agent.json pointing to the character file.\nInstall dependencies: pnpm install.\nEnsure correct plugins are installed and linked to the agent package:\npnpm remove @elizaos/plugin-local-ai (if present)\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-anthropic@latest -F @elizaos/agent\npnpm add @elizaos/plugin-twitter@latest -F @elizaos/agent\npnpm install\nBuild the project: pnpm build.\nStart the agent: pnpm start --characters=\"characters/flappy.character.json\".\n\nExpected Result:\nThe agent starts fully, logs confirm Twitter login and timeline handling begins, and subsequent AI tasks utilize the Anthropic API via the loaded plugin. The process remains active and responsive.\n\nActual Result:\nThe agent process hangs indefinitely after the SUCCESS: REST API bound to... log message. No further logs related to Twitter client initialization, AI provider interaction, or timeline handling appear. The process doesn't exit or crash.\n\n\n``` Relevant Logs:\n\n[2025-05-08 01:16:54] SUCCESS: REST API bound to 0.0.0.0:3000.
