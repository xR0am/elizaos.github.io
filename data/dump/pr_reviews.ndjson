When I run them in codespaces with `npm run test` I am getting a bunch of failures. Some of them are related to `No test files found, exiting with code 1` (we should fix that for CI purposes) but there's also `token.test.ts` test file that fails with:\r\n```\r\n FAIL  src/tests/token.test.ts [ src/tests/token.test.ts ]\r\nError: Failed to resolve entry for package \"@ai16z/plugin-solana\". The package may have incorrect main/module/exports specified in its package.json.\r\n```\r\nThe thing is that I see `@ai16z/plugin-solana` installed as a dependency.

Here are the key points:\r\n\r\n\u2705 The number of sections in the English and Romanian README files match, indicating the overall structure is similar. \r\n\r\n\u2705 Key phrases and core content appear to be translated accurately in the Romanian version.\r\n\r\n\u26a0\ufe0f However, the section titles and ordering don't match exactly between the two versions.\r\n\r\n## Section Differences\r\n\r\nThe Romanian README has sections that don't appear to have direct equivalents in the English version:\r\n\r\n- `## Rularea cu modele diferite` (Running with different models)\r\n- `## Cerin\u021be suplimentare` (Additional requirements)\r\n- `## Telegram` \r\n- `## Bot Discord`\r\n- `## Teste` (Tests)\r\n\r\nThese sections seem to provide more details on configuring and running the bot with different models, setting up specific clients like Telegram and Discord, and running tests.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the English README has some sections missing in the Romanian version:\r\n\r\n- `## \ud83c\udf0d README Translations`\r\n- `## Video Tutorials`\r\n- `## \ud83d\ude80 Quick Start`\r\n- `## Contributors`\r\n- `## Star History`\r\n\r\nSo the Romanian version is missing information on alternate translations, video tutorials, a quick start guide, contributor info, and star history.\r\n\r\nSome section titles that do overlap have different names:\r\n- `## \u2728 Features` (EN) vs `## Func\u021bionalit\u0103\u021bi` (RO)\r\n- `## \ud83c\udfaf Use Cases` (EN) vs `## Pentru ce pot s\u0103-l folosesc?` (RO)\r\n\r\n## Recommendations\r\n\r\nTo fully align the English and Romanian READMEs, consider the following:\r\n\r\n1. Add the additional technical sections from the Romanian version to the English README where appropriate, to cover those extra details.\r\n\r\n2. Translate the meta project info sections from the English version and add them to the Romanian README.\r\n\r\n3. Rename the overlapping sections to match between the two versions for consistency.\r\n\r\n4. Review the ordering of sections and adjust as needed so they follow the same logical flow in both versions.\r\n\r\nOverall the translation looks good in terms of the core content, just needs some structural alignment.

This inconsistency can lead to confusion and potential runtime errors downstream. Consider throwing an error in both cases or handling both uniformly.\n\n\n\nOption 1: Throw an error when `privateKey` is missing.\n\n```diff\n export async function getZilliqaWalletClient(\n     getSetting: (key: string) => string | undefined\n ): Promise<ZilliqaWalletClient | null> {\n     const privateKey = getSetting(\"EVM_PRIVATE_KEY\");\n-    if (!privateKey) return null;\n+    if (!privateKey) throw new Error(\"EVM_PRIVATE_KEY not configured\");\n\n     const provider = getSetting(\"EVM_PROVIDER_URL\");\n     if (!provider) throw new Error(\"EVM_PROVIDER_URL not configured\");\n     // ...\n }\n```\n\nOption 2: Return `null` when either is missing.\n\n```diff\n export async function getZilliqaWalletClient(\n     getSetting: (key: string) => string | undefined\n ): Promise<ZilliqaWalletClient | null> {\n     const privateKey = getSetting(\"EVM_PRIVATE_KEY\");\n     if (!privateKey) return null;\n\n     const provider = getSetting(\"EVM_PROVIDER_URL\");\n-    if (!provider) throw new Error(\"EVM_PROVIDER_URL not configured\");\n+    if (!provider) return null;\n     // ...\n }\n```\n\n---\n\n`42-42`: **Add error handling for `zilliqaChainId` retrieval**\n\nThe call to `zilliqaChainId(provider)` may fail due to network issues or invalid provider URLs. Consider wrapping this call in a `try-catch` block to handle potential exceptions gracefully.\n\n\n\nApply this diff:\n\n```diff\n const provider = getSetting(\"EVM_PROVIDER_URL\");\n if (!provider) throw new Error(\"EVM_PROVIDER_URL not configured\");\n\n-const chainId = await zilliqaChainId(provider);\n+let chainId: number;\n+try {\n+    chainId = await zilliqaChainId(provider);\n+} catch (error) {\n+    throw new Error(`Failed to retrieve chain ID: ${error.message}`);\n+}\n```\n\n---\n\n`54-84`: **Specify return types in `getWalletProviders`**\n\nThe `getWalletProviders` function and its inner `get` methods lack explicit return types, which can affect readability and maintainability.\n\n\n\nAdd return types to the function and methods:\n\n```diff\n export function getWalletProviders(\n     walletClient: WalletClientBase,\n     zilliqa: ZilliqaWalletClient\n-)\n+): { get(): Promise<string | null> }[] {\n     return [\n         {\n             async get(): Promise<string | null> {\n                 // ...\n             },\n         },\n         {\n             async get(): Promise<string | null> {\n                 // ...\n             },\n         },\n     ];\n }\n```\n\n</blockquote></details>\n<details>\n<summary>packages/plugin-zilliqa/src/actions.ts (1)</summary><blockquote>\n\n`155-218`: **Add type annotations for `getActionHandler` parameters and return type**\n\nExplicit type annotations enhance code readability and maintainability.\n\n\n\nAdd type annotations:\n\n```diff\n function getActionHandler(\n     actionName: string,\n     actionDescription: string,\n     tools: Record<string, unknown>\n-)\n+): HandlerCallback {\n     return async (\n         runtime: IAgentRuntime,\n         message: Memory,\n-        state: State | undefined,\n+        state?: State,\n         options?: Record<string, unknown>,\n         callback?: HandlerCallback\n-    ): Promise<boolean> => {\n+    ) => {\n         // ...\n     };\n }\n```\n\nEnsure that `HandlerCallback` is correctly imported or defined.\n\n</blockquote></details>\n<details>\n<summary>packages/plugin-zilliqa/src/index.ts (1)</summary><blockquote>\n\n`15-15`: **Ensure `zilliqaWalletClient` is not `null` before passing to providers**\n\nPassing a potentially `null` `zilliqaWalletClient` to `getWalletProviders` can lead to unexpected behavior.\n\n\n\nSince you've added a null check above, this issue would be resolved.

The use of optional className chaining with `${className || ''}` is a good pattern.\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>packages/client/src/routes/edit-character.tsx (1)</summary>\n\n`50-52`: **Potential character identification issue.**\n\nThe character usage check relies on both ID and name matching, which could lead to false positives if character names aren't unique across the system.\n\nConsider prioritizing ID-based matching or implementing a more robust identification system:\n\n```diff\n-  const isCharacterInUse = Array.isArray(agents) ? agents.some((agent: Agent) => \n-    agent.character?.id === data?.id || agent.character?.name === urlCharacterName\n-  ) : false;\n+  const isCharacterInUse = Array.isArray(agents) ? agents.some((agent: Agent) => \n+    agent.character?.id === data?.id\n+  ) : false;\n```\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>packages/plugin-sql/src/base.ts (2)</summary>\n\n`214-233`: **Well-implemented agent counting method.**\n\nThe `countAgents` method is properly structured with good error handling and logging.\n\n---\n\n`1130-1145`: **Updated method signature with appropriate implementation.**\n\nThe `getRoomsForParticipant` method has been updated to include `agentId` parameter and properly uses it in the query conditions.\n\nMake sure to update all method calls throughout the codebase to provide the new required parameter.\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>packages/client/src/components/room-list.tsx (1)</summary>\n\n`24-30`: **Type definition may need runtime verification.**\n\nThe `ContentWithUser` type extends the core `Content` type with additional fields that might not always be present in API responses.\n\nAdd null/undefined checks when accessing these fields or verify the API response structure:\n\n```javascript\n// Example of safe access\n{msg.user ? (msg.user === 'user' ? 'You' : 'Agent') : 'Unknown'}\n```\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>packages/client/src/routes/characters.tsx (3)</summary>\n\n`1-20`: **Clean import organization and usage.**\nAll imports appear relevant and well-structured for this feature. No concerns here.\n\n---\n\n`56-59`: **Refetch strategy looks solid.**\nInvalidating queries achieves the desired refresh behavior for characters. No further issues identified.\n\n---\n\n`61-119`: **Responsive layout and user flow.**\nThe grid-based rendering for characters is straightforward. The addition of the \u201cNew Character\u201d placeholder card is a clean UI pattern. Looks good!\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>packages/client/src/routes/home.tsx (5)</summary>\n\n`2-6`: **Compact import strategy.**\nImports are well referenced for ActionCard, hooks, and icons. No issues found.\n\n---\n\n`11-15`: **Sensible fallback for agents and characters.**\nDefaulting to empty arrays ensures robust rendering without null checks. This is a good practice.\n\n---\n\n`24-28`: **Clear loading state.**\nDisplaying a loading message helps user experience. No problems noted.\n\n---\n\n`34-48`: **Helpful message for empty agent list.**\nPrompting users to create characters is logical. The conditional check for `characterCount > 0` is a nice touch.\n\n---\n\n`50-63`: **Well-structured grid layout for agents.**\nUsing the `ActionCard` consistently improves readability. Linking to `/chat` and `/settings` is straightforward.\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>packages/client/src/components/connection-status.tsx (7)</summary>\n\n`1-4`: **Good approach for external modules.**\nThe import statements align with the new logic to track connection status and query states.\n\n---\n\n`12-17`: **Use of additional state variables.**\nTracking tab visibility, online status, and hover is beneficial. Implementation is concise and well-named.\n\n---\n\n`26-68`: **Visibility and network event handling logic is well-structured.**\nThe document and window event listeners reset failure counts and invalidate queries at appropriate times. This enhances reliability.\n\n---\n\n`70-83`: **Dynamic polling interval.**\nAdjusting based on offline status, tab visibility, and exponential backoff is a robust pattern.\n\n---\n\n`85-117`: **Graceful error handling for fetch.**\nIncrementing the `failureCountRef` for exponential backoff is well done. `try`/`catch` usage for queryFn is appropriate.\n\n---\n\n`120-125`: **Status visualization and logic.**\nThe color-coded indicators and text are intuitive. The `isLongOutage` distinction further refines the user experience.\n\n\n\nAlso applies to: 127-160\n\n---\n\n`165-189`: **Hover interaction and refresh trigger.**\nUser-driven refresh with resetting the failure count is a practical design. Implementation looks good.\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>packages/client/src/routes/new-character.tsx (1)</summary>\n\n`41-41`: **Confirm `bio` vs `system` usage.**\nHere you override `bio` with content derived from `character.system`. Double-check whether this aligns with the intended behavior (e.g., storing the system prompt lines in `bio`).\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>packages/client/src/components/chat.tsx (1)</summary>\n\n`178-189`: **Verify timestamp usage.**\nUsing `Date.now()` for both user and system messages discards server-generated timestamps. If accurate timestamps matter, expose them from the server or preserve them in the API response.\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>packages/client/src/App.tsx (2)</summary>\n\n`65-74`: **Review duplicate prefetch calls.**\n`prefetchInitialData` runs immediately and again in the `useEffect`. Verify that running it twice has benefits or if it\u2019s redundant for your use case.\n\n---\n\n`92-94`: **Ensure usability of new character routes.**\nThese new routes for character management look consistent. Confirm that links or navigation references across the app reliably lead users here, preventing any broken flow.\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>packages/client/src/components/overview.tsx (4)</summary>\n\n`68-80`: **Logical structure for toggling plugins is good**  \nThe toggle logic succinctly adds or removes a plugin from the array. This approach is clean and efficient.\n\n---\n\n`116-142`: **Graceful stop and navigation**  \nThe function properly stops the agent, clears the caches, and navigates home. Good job ensuring user feedback with alerts and error handling.\n\n---\n\n`278-291`: **Integrating CharacterForm**  \nUsing a single form component for updates is consistent with DRY principles. Great approach to unify editing logic via `CharacterForm`.\n\n---\n\n`11-11`: <details>\n<summary>\u2705 Verification successful</summary>\n\n**Verify \u201cSeparator\u201d usage vs. pipeline error**  \nThe pipeline flagged `'Separator' is declared but its value is never read`. However, it's referenced on line 224. Please verify whether you need to remove or rename the import or if this is a false positive.\n\n---\n\n\ud83c\udfc1 Script executed:\n\n```shell\n#!/bin/bash\n# Checks usage of Separator in all files under packages/client/src\nrg \"Separator\" packages/client/src\n```\n\nLength of output: 2154\n\n---\n\n\n\n</details>\n\n**False Positive: 'Separator' is actively used in the codebase.**  \nThe grep output confirms that the `<Separator />` component is used on line 224 in `packages/client/src/components/overview.tsx` (and in other parts of the codebase), so no changes are necessary.\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>packages/client/src/components/character-form.tsx (4)</summary>\n\n`15-38`: **ErrorBoundary component**  \nThis boundary catches rendering errors well. Just be sure it\u2019s placed high enough in the tree to capture form crashes.\n\n---\n\n`210-230`: **Amenable array updates**  \nThe `updateArray` approach for handling array fields is straightforward. Good job ensuring the updated data merges seamlessly with the rest of the object.\n\n---\n\n`249-265`: **Clean delete handling**  \nThe deletion logic is simple and keeps the UI consistent by disabling the button mid-process. Nice detail.\n\n---\n\n`267-402`: **Robust form structure**  \nTabs and contextual sections help organize the editing flow. This is a user-friendly design.\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>packages/agent/src/server/api/agent.ts (2)</summary>\n\n`793-871`: **Room management**  \nThe new room retrieval and creation endpoints offer better multi-user conversation handling. The logs thoroughly trace each step, aiding debugging. Nicely done.\n\n---\n\n`424-447`: **Agent start with dynamic character**  \nAccepting both `characterPath` and `characterJson` makes the endpoint versatile. Good error messages for missing parameters.\n\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>packages/client/src/hooks/use-query-hooks.ts (1)</summary>\n\n`164-181`: **Use consistent approach for polling intervals.**  \nYour approach to adjusting refetch intervals based on network conditions is effective. Make sure to periodically test on slow connections to confirm performance meets user expectations.\n\n</details>\n\n</blockquote></details>\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment by CodeRabbit for review status -->", "2025-02-27T14:48:39Z", "coderabbitai", "2025-04-14 21:54:42"]

Long items need to be chunked into sections of ~2000 or 4000 tokens for retrieval. We have a `splitChunks` function that should do this nicely. However, we'll need to store fragments separately from documents. I suggest that we have a 'documents' table as well as a 'fragments' table, and fragments link to their source documents.\r\n\r\nThis will take a little architectural thought to not be ugly.
