I suggest trying to do use the following to test it locally: \r\n\r\n\u2022 Description: \u201cact\u201d is a command-line utility written in Go that lets you run your GitHub Actions workflows locally.\r\n\u2022 How It Works: It parses your workflow .yml files and simulates GitHub Actions events (push, pull_request, etc.) in Docker containers on your local machine.\r\n\u2022 Why It\u2019s Good:\r\n\r\nGreat for quickly iterating on a workflow without having to push to a branch repeatedly.\r\nLets you see console output, debug logs, and environment variables as if you were running on GitHub.\r\n\u2022 Potential Drawbacks:\r\nNot all GitHub Actions are guaranteed to work seamlessly. Some might rely on GitHub-hosted runners or environment specifics that \u201cact\u201d may not perfectly replicate.\r\nYou need Docker installed locally.\r\n\u2022 How to Get Started Quickly:\r\nInstall Docker.\r\nInstall act (on macOS you can use Homebrew: brew install act, or grab the binary from the GitHub releases page).\r\nFrom your repository, run:\r\nact <event_name>\r\nFor example, act push or act pull_request.\r\nBy default, act uses a lightweight Docker image for its runner; for more complex workflows you might need:\r\nact <event_name> --medium or --workflows .github/workflows/<your_workflow.yml>\r\n"

This is particularly important as it will improve accessibility and inclusivity for the growing tech community in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdd a complete Tagalog translation of the main README.md as README_TG.md, including:\r\n- Full translation of all sections, including features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines\r\n- Proper formatting to ensure readability\r\n- Addition of Tagalog (Tagalog) to the language selector at the top of all README files\r\n- Maintenance of all existing functionality (links, images, code blocks)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nUsing browser-based translation tools (like Chrome's translate feature) \u2013 inadequate because automated translations may not accurately capture technical terms and nuances in Tagalog.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nTagalog is spoken by millions of Filipinos and is one of the primary languages in the Philippines.\r\nThe translation should follow the same pattern as other language translations in the repo (README_XX.md format).\r\nThis addition will make the project more accessible to the Filipino developer community.\r\n",

An independent new Solana feature module has been introduced without modifying the code of other parts.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n- There are some distinctive liquid staking solutions on Solana. However, users or developers need to provide a specific APP for users to conduct staking.\r\n- Liquid Staking Action aims to enable users to interact with the Agent through natural language. The Eliza Agent will build transactions for users. The front-end only needs to integrate a Solana wallet to support multiple staking protocols, eliminating the need to code and integrate the specific logic of different staking protocols.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\n- When the user specifies a liquid staking protocol, build the corresponding transaction (base58 encoded) for the user.\r\n- When the user does not specify a specific protocol, based on the APY and TVL data of multiple protocols provided by the StakeProtocolProvider, use the designated LLM to optimize the staking protocol for the user and then build the corresponding transaction.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- No\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n- packages/plugin-solana/src/actions/liquidStake.ts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1.

This reduces flexibility and can increase development complexity in scenarios where different models are needed.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n- Remove the hard-coded `model class` reference in the `generateText` function and instead use a model name/type passed in as a function parameter or configuration.\r\n- Ensure there is a sensible default value to maintain compatibility with existing functionality or cases where a specific model is not provided.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n- Leaving it as is would require manual code changes to switch models in different scenarios, which is not ideal.\r\n- Introducing a separate function to handle switching model classes could lead to redundant logic and increase maintenance overhead.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n- **Risks**: This change is minor, but it\u2019s important to check if other parts of the code depend on the old hard-coded logic.\r\n- **Testing**:\r\n  - Test with multiple model types to confirm that the function correctly switches to the specified model.",

Please describe.**\r\n\r\nCurrently, there are various liquid staking protocols on Solana, but users or developers often need to build dedicated front-end solutions or switch between multiple platforms to compare APYs and select the appropriate protocol before staking. This process is tedious and increases front-end development complexity, making it cumbersome for users.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\n- Add the ability for liquid staking to the existing ElizaOS Solana plugin, simplifying the process of building staking requests for users without requiring specialized front-end logic.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n- Continue relying on each protocol\u2019s custom front-end or having developers integrate multiple protocols manually. This leads to high complexity and development cost.  \r\n- Have users manually compare different platforms\u2019 APYs, which can be error-prone and inconvenient.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n",

This shift will scale message traffic astronomically, analogous to the web\u2019s rise in the 2000s. Just as Cloudflare and https secured web traffic, messaging will need robust scalable end-to-end encrypted messages to protect sensitive information.\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nRisks of not using end-to-end encryption for agent interactions exposes the users to what is called as Man in the **Middle Attacks**.\r\n\r\n> **Man in the Middle Attacks**: Intercept requests in between to alter or manipulate data sent or received by the AI service\r\n\r\n- **Phishing**: Messages can be intercepted and manipulated.\r\n- **Privacy**: Sensitive information read by unwanted parties\r\n- **Tampering**: Content can be altered without detection.\r\n\r\n:::tip\r\nMore concrete sensitive data could include credit card details, private keys and passwords which is not yet widely spread but as agents become smarter more use cases will include this type of sharing.\r\n:::\r\n\r\n## XMTP\r\n\r\nEliza agents come with a ready to use client that uses XMTP providing end-to-end encrypted messaging for every agent intereaction, crucial for privacy, security, and compliance provided by the XMTP network.\r\n\r\n### Features:\r\n\r\n- **E2EE**: End to end encrypted MLS encryption\r\n- **Multi-agent**: Support multi-agent through group chats\r\n- **Interoperable**: Works across all platforms and frontends\r\n- **Scalable**: Decentralized, open-source\r\n- **Anonymous**: By default every identity is ephemeral and anonymous.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n\r\nInstall the `xmtp` package\r\n\r\n```bash [cmd]\r\nbun install xmtp\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\nThis is how you can use the `xmtp` package to create an agent and handle messages.\r\n\r\n- `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`: This will encrypt all messages and make it available through its public address or ens domain.\r\n\r\n```tsx\r\nimport { XMTP } from \"xmtp\";\r\n\r\nconst xmtp = new XMTP(onMessage, {\r\n    encryptionKey: WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY,\r\n});\r\nawait xmtp.init();\r\nconst onMessage = async (message, user) => {\r\n    console.log(`Decoded message: ${message.content.text} by ${user.address}`);\r\n    // Your AI model response\r\n    await xmtp.send({\r\n        message: response,\r\n        originalMessage: message,\r\n    });\r\n};\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor more information visit XMTP [website](https://xmtp.org/)",

I have also updated the .env.example to include the additional variables for the mongo connection. And added to the agent index with functionality to initialise this database if required. \r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nAdding an additional feature \r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nIn my day job we exclusively use mongoDB for our database needs, for commercials and performance reasons. As we want to develop AI Agents, we need to have the mongoDB adaptor. IN the sprit of OpenSource I wanted to make sure it was available for the whole community to use as well. \r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nA small additional input to the documentation is required to make users aware of the additional functionality and how it can be actioned. \r\nSimilar to the Postgres set up just adding in the appropriate connection string to the .env file will action he change to start using MongoDB as the database. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nThe reviewer will need to have a least  a free account with mongoDB atlas, then add the connection string and a Database name to the .env file. After that the agent should run as expected, saving memories as before. The reviewer can verify the saved data inside the MongoDB interface. \r\n \r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Create MongoDB atlas account \r\n2. Add connection string and Database name to .env file \r\n3. Run agent \r\n4. Verify inside MongoDB interface that the collections have formed and data is being stored \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/ai16z and state your Discord username here for contribute role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Discord username\r\njoby3186\r\n-->\r\n",
