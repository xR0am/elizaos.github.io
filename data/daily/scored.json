Please describe.**\r\n\r\n\r\nThe starknet plugin package needs a few fix/features especially in the `/src/providers` folder e.g.: \r\nhttps://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/ea9d1c02291dea26b25c815be30db5c91e6ceb21/packages/plugin-starknet/src/providers/trustScoreProvider.ts#L22\r\nImporting a non existent file and the trustScoreProvider functionality not quite there yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n### **Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdapt the plugin to starknet, fix imports and wallet methods calls. See here for example:\r\nhttps://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/ea9d1c02291dea26b25c815be30db5c91e6ceb21/packages/plugin-starknet/src/providers/token.ts#L131-L137\r\nInstead of `.fetchPortfolioValue()`, the correct method should likely be https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/blob/ea9d1c02291dea26b25c815be30db5c91e6ceb21/packages/plugin-starknet/src/providers/portfolioProvider.ts#L28\r\nand the imported Promise<`Item`> (in`token.ts`) is not defined yet.\r\n\r\n",
