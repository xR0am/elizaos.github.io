List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR enhances the composeContext function by integrating Handlebars as an optional templating engine. Users can now choose between simple key replacement or advanced template features provided by Handlebars, such as conditionals and loops.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n- Feature: Adds a new functionality to support Handlebars templating engine.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n- Yes: Update documentation to include examples of using the Handlebars templating engine with composeContext.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf a docs change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested, and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n- Review the changes in context.ts and the newly added tests in context.test.ts.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n- Run the tests in context.test.ts to verify both the simple string replacement and Handlebars functionality.\r\n- Ensure all scenarios, including edge cases like missing values and advanced Handlebars templates, are covered by tests.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos. This will speed up PRs being merged. It is extra nice to annotate screenshots with arrows or boxes pointing out the differences. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Before\r\n### After\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deploy, please make a note. -->\r\n<!--\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0Copy and paste commandline output. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Database changes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- \u00a0If there is something more than the automated steps, please specifiy deploy instructions. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/ai16z and state your Discord username here for contribute role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nkaboom89\r\n\r\n",

This usually costs money, however there exists a free option today: chatapi.akash.network. This is an openAI api compatible api that runs standard LLMs like llama3.1-405B and llama3.3-70B for free! \r\n\r\nThe official announcement of the public release: https://x.com/akashnet_/status/1814018478845616362 \r\nYou can get your api key here: https://chatapi.akash.network\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nAdds a new model provider to the list of model providers\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why. If there is a related issue it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nIm a big fan of the work of akash.network and I've been using this service myself for a while now. Its great to have access to bigger models for testing without risking huge token spends on your personal creditcard\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation. The env variables are added in the .env.example including the relevant links to where to get the key and how it works.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\nI tested it by following the steps below and got the following result:\r\n<img width=\"391\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-16 at 3 35 14\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29e89c34-e8f5-47c3-9ffa-130152d65227\" />\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nFollow the test steps below (should be really easy!)\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nEasiest way to test is to do the following:\r\n1. clone repo\r\n2. Go to https://chatapi.akash.network and request a new api key (no email required, optional)\r\n3. run `cp .env.example .env` in the root and set the api key here\r\nhttps://github.com/MbBrainz/eliza/blob/de87bfaa308091ff14ff488f5a446cf72b8904c4/.env.example#L234C1-L238C73 \r\n4. change the model provider in  `./packages/core/src/defaultCharacter.ts` to `modelProvider: ModelProviderName.AKASH_CHAT_API,`\r\n5. run `pnpm build & pnpm start`\r\n6. send a msg and verify if the model is akash_chat_api and if it responds\r\n7 \u2705\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nMbBrainz\r\n",

            "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWhen trying to build a pnpm monorepo using Nix's buildNpmPackage that includes git dependencies (specifically @discordjs/opus), the build fails due to git access restrictions in the Nix build environment. The current workarounds involve either modifying package.json or pre-fetching git dependencies, both of which are not ideal solutions for maintaining the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nA built-in way to handle git dependencies in buildNpmPackage that:\r\n\r\n 1. Automatically fetches git dependencies using fetchgit during the build process\r\n 2. Maintains compatibility with pnpm workspaces and monorepo structure\r\n 3. Preserves the original package.json without requiring modifications\r\n 4. Works with trusted dependencies in pnpm\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n1. Manually pre-fetching git dependencies and placing them in node_modules\r\n2. Modifying package.json to use published versions instead of git dependencies\r\n3. Using mkDerivation instead of buildNpmPackage to handle the build process manually\r\n4. Creating a custom derivation to handle git dependencies before the main build\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis issue particularly affects projects using Discord.js and similar packages that rely on git dependencies for native modules. The current workarounds either break the development workflow or require maintaining separate package configurations for Nix builds.\r\nExample of a failing build: \r\n\r\n`ERR_PNPM_LOCKFILE_CONFIG_MISMATCH Cannot proceed with the frozen installation. The current \"overrides\" configuration doesn't match the value found in the lockfile`\r\n",
