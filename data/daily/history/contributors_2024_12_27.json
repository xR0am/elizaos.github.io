Initialize the plugin by setting `FERE_USER_ID` in runtime settings.  \r\n2. Send a WebSocket message through `sendFereProMessage` action.  \r\n3. Verify structured response by logging `ChatResponse` details (answer, chat_id, credits used).  \r\n4. Trigger error cases by using invalid WebSocket URLs and observe error handling behavior.  \r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes  \r\n- No database changes.  \r\n- Ensure the WebSocket URL and user ID are correctly set in the environment configuration before deployment.  \r\n",
