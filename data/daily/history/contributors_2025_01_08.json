Changes are additive and follow existing patterns.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR adds support for a new embedding provider called \"Heurist\" with the following changes:\r\n1. Adds HEURIST_EMBEDDING_MODEL configuration with BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 as default\r\n2. Integrates Heurist into the embedding provider system with 1024 dimension vectors\r\n3. Updates model configurations to use meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct and FLUX.1-dev\r\n4. Implements remote embedding functionality for the Heurist provider\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality) - Adds new embedding provider capability\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation to document the new Heurist embedding provider and its configuration options.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Check the .env.example file for the new HEURIST_EMBEDDING_MODEL configuration\r\n2. Review the embedding.ts changes for proper integration\r\n3. Verify the model configuration updates in the Models section\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Configure HEURIST_EMBEDDING_MODEL in environment\r\n2. Test embedding generation with the new provider:\r\n   - Verify 1024-dimension vectors are generated correctly\r\n   - Confirm remote embedding functionality works\r\n   - Check fallback to BGE when appropriate\r\n\r\n\r\n## Screenshots\r\nN/A - No UI changes involved\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nThe following environment variables need to be configured:\r\n- USE_HEURIST_EMBEDDING = true\r\n- HEURIST_EMBEDDING_MODEL=BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5\r\n- HEURIST_API_KEY (if using remote embeddings)",

I also noticed that the XAI_API_KEY is only used for loading the Together API but it has it's own API key var now (which can be used to load the provider). Should I go ahead and remove it as well? I feel like most people think these vars are related to X/Twitter or xAI and may be confused by them.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nA lot of the documentation does need to be updated to reflect the changes to selecting providers and models. Many may be trying to use this unworking and unused variable. I removed it from the Readme's on here in this PR though.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR.

It is self-contained. The plugin globally wraps axios in a SOCKS proxy opened up by the Anyone Client, this is within `packages/plugin-anyone/src/services`.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nTo thoroughly test, another plugin was made but not committed on this PR to check for the users current IP. Here the user can check their IP, startup the anyone client and check their IP again which should be different as it is routed through the network. By extension, this should therefore work for other plugins users may use that uses axios. \r\nAnother plugin was created to check the IP and added to the main agent `index.ts`. Cloning this [branch](https://github.com/Saundr21/eliza/tree/testing/anyone-ip) should do most of the testing steps automatically.\r\n\r\nThe image outlines how the plugin works.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"915\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e58acf59-d109-4256-b59c-e3f3a21cfe39\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone: Automated tests are acceptable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

However, when interacting with the model, the ai agent calls my custom Action's validate function, which returns false. Initially, I thought that if validate returns false, the handle function of the Action should not execute. But from the logs I output, it appears that the handle function is also executed. Why is this happening?\r\nIf the validate function returns false, but the action still executes, what is the purpose of the return value of validate?\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b195d5b-9488-49dc-aa24-53b1e3b41aea)\r\nThe description in the documentation is also not clear enough.",

            "body": "# Relates to\r\n\r\nThis PR relates to the following issues:\r\n\r\nObsidian Integration #302 \r\n\r\nThe development and maintenance of the @elizaos/plugin-obsidian package, focusing on enhancing elizaOS agents integration capabilities with Obsidian vaults.\r\n\r\n### Key features include:\r\n\r\n1. Deep traversal of Obsidian notes:\r\n   - Implementing hierarchical note structure analysis\r\n   - Enabling traversal of note links and backlinks\r\n   - Storing hierarchy data in memory for efficient access\r\n\r\n2. Advanced search functionality:\r\n   - Full-text search across all vault files\r\n   - Support for regex patterns and context-aware searches\r\n   - Integration with Obsidian's native search capabilities using Obsidian's Rest API\r\n\r\n3. Obsidian memory store integration:\r\n   - Building and maintaining a knowledge base from vault notes\r\n   - Implementing efficient data structures for quick retrieval\r\n\r\n4. Naval database integration as an example:\r\n   - Demonstrating how to import and structure obsidian notes\r\n   - Showcasing integration of Naval's wisdom and quotes\r\n   - Creating a knowledge base from Naval's vault notes\r\n   - Naval's character json file is included in the PR\r\n\r\nThese enhancements aim to provide users with powerful tools for knowledge management and retrieval within their Obsidian vaults, while also demonstrating the plugin's extensibility for integrating external data sources.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow - This is a plugin package that integrates with Obsidian vault functionality using the Obsidian Rest API.\r\n\r\nMain risks include:\r\n\r\n- File system operations safety\r\n- Data integrity when reading/writing notes\r\n- Performance with large vaults\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR maintains the Obsidian plugin package which provides integration between ELIZA OS agents and Obsidian vaults. The plugin enables:\r\n\r\n- File and note management within Obsidian vaults\r\n- Search functionality using Omnisearch\r\n- Note traversal and knowledge base features\r\n- Active note operations and file manipulation\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality):\r\n\r\n- Obsidian Vault operations (listing files, directory management)\r\n- Note management (content retrieval, metadata handling)\r\n- Search capabilities\r\n- File operations (read, write, update)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- [X] My changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\nObsisdian plugin is documented in the package README.md which includes:\r\n\r\n- Features documentation\r\n- Usage examples\r\n- API documentation\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the main plugin definition in `src/index.ts`\r\n2. Check individual action implementations in `src/actions/`\r\n3. Verify the API documentation in README.md\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Setup Testing Environment\r\n\r\n   ```bash\r\n   # Install dependencies\r\n   pnpm install\r\n\r\n   # Run tests\r\n   pnpm test\r\n\r\n   # For development with watch mode\r\n   pnpm run test:watch\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Core API Tests (`src/tests/obsidianClient.test.ts`)\r\n   - Test Authentication:\r\n     - Verify successful connection to Obsidian API\r\n     - Test authentication failure scenarios\r\n\r\n   - Test Note Operations:\r\n     - List all notes in vault\r\n     - Get specific note content by path\r\n     - Get active note content\r\n     - Verify note metadata and frontmatter parsing\r\n\r\n   - Test File Operations:\r\n     - List all files in vault\r\n     - List files in specific directory\r\n     - Read file contents\r\n     - Test file write/update operations\r\n\r\n   - Test Search Functionality:\r\n     - Plain text search: `obsidianProvider.search('query', 'plaintext')`\r\n     - Dataview queries: `obsidianProvider.search('TABLE field FROM \"folder\"', 'dataview')`\r\n     - JSON Logic queries: `obsidianProvider.search({ var: 'field' }, 'jsonlogic')`\r\n     - Keyword search: `obsidianProvider.searchKeywords('keyword1 OR keyword2')`\r\n\r\n   - Test Command Integration:\r\n     - List available Obsidian commands\r\n     - Execute commands through API\r\n\r\n3. Error Handling Tests\r\n   - Test API connection failures\r\n   - Verify error handling for invalid requests\r\n   - Check error messages for missing files/notes\r\n   - Test authentication error scenarios\r\n\r\n4. Integration Testing\r\n   - Test plugin integration with Obsidian app\r\n   - Verify real-time updates and file synchronization\r\n   - Test concurrent operations handling\r\n   - Verify memory management and cleanup\r\n\r\nExpected test results:\r\n\r\n- All unit tests should pass\r\n- API endpoints should respond with correct data\r\n- Error scenarios should be properly handled\r\n- No memory leaks in long-running operations\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

            "body": "# Relates to\r\n\r\nNo specific issue or ticket.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow \u2013 The changes are isolated to a new plugin addition and do not affect existing functionality.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\nSpheron is the largest GPU supercompute network, designed to deploy workloads in a modular and decentralized way. Our platform offers developers a robust infrastructure for running various workloads efficiently, leveraging the power of decentralized systems. With Spheron, users can deploy a wide range of templates and workload, making it a flexible solution for diverse computational needs.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a new plugin to the Spheron ecosystem that allows users to deploy specific templates (e.g., Ollama, VSCode, Jupyter Notebook, and Heurist Miner) on Spheronk. The plugin serves as a foundation to make workload deployment with natural language, enabling the creation and deployment of additional agents or workloads, such as deploying one Eliza agent from another. This functionality significantly expands the Eliza plugin ecosystem's potential and enhances its utility.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Addition of a new plugin (non-breaking change).\r\n- The plugin can be imported separately to enable the functionality without affecting other modules.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nSpheron is building the largest GPU supercompute network, designed to deploy workloads in a super-modular way on our decentralized infrastructure. By integrating this plugin, we simplify deploying various supported templates and lay the groundwork for more complex deployments and agent-based interactions. This addition is a meaningful step in growing the Eliza plugin ecosystem and offering more powerful, modular tools for our users.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- Documentation has been updated in the `adapter-reclaim` README.\r\n- No further changes to the project documentation are required.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nAll the changes are in `plugin-spheron` directory\r\nBegin by following the steps outlined in the detailed testing steps below.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Create a wallet using the instructions here: [Spheron Docs: Create new wallet](https://docs.spheron.network/user-guide/deploy-your-app#step-2-create-a-new-wallet-using-the-cli).\r\n\r\n2. Request test tokens:  \r\n   - Obtain test USDT and ETH tokens from the team.  \r\n   - Share your wallet address with me, and I\u2019ll allocate the necessary tokens.\r\n\r\n3. Export your wallet's private key:  \r\n   Refer to the guide: [Spheron Doc: Export private key from wallet](https://docs.spheron.network/user-guide/protocol-cli#export-the-private-key-of-wallet).\r\n\r\n4. Configure the environment variables using your private key and wallet address:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   SPHERON_PRIVATE_KEY=\r\n   SPHERON_PROVIDER_PROXY_URL=http://localhost:3040\r\n   SPHERON_WALLET_ADDRESS=\r\n   ```\r\n 5. Deploy a character using the command:\r\n    ```bash\r\n    pnpm start --characters=\"./characters/trump.character.json\"\r\n    ```\r\n 6. Start the client: `pnpm start:client`\r\n 7. Interact with Eliza to initiate a deployment. Example:\r\n    ```\r\n    User: \"deploy a jupyter notebook with 2 RTX4090 GPUs, 4 CPUs, 8GB RAM, and 100GB storage for 3 hours.\"\r\n    Agent: \"Jupyter Notebook deployed with specs as requested for 3 hours.\"\r\n    Agent: \"Deployment created and ready!\r\n        Lease ID: 72837\r\n        Access URLs: provider.abc.com:23283 for 8888\"\r\n    ```\r\n \r\n## Discord username\r\n---> rekpero",

Previously, the model would be initialized multiple times during character knowledge processing, leading to high RAM usage (8-12GB & even more). With this change, the model is initialized once and reused, reducing RAM usage to less than 1GB.\r\n\r\nThe root issue lies in the FastEmbed library's initialization and Eliza's reinitialization:\r\n```typescript\r\nstatic async init({\r\n    model = EmbeddingModel.BGESmallENV15,\r\n    executionProviders = [ExecutionProvider.CPU],\r\n    maxLength = 512,\r\n    cacheDir = \"local_cache\",\r\n    showDownloadProgress = true,\r\n}) {\r\n    const session = await ort.InferenceSession.create(modelPath, {\r\n      executionProviders,\r\n      graphOptimizationLevel: \"all\",\r\n    });\r\n    return new FlagEmbedding(tokenizer, session, model);\r\n}\r\n```\r\nref: https://github.com/Anush008/fastembed-js\r\n\r\nWhen this init function is called, The ort inference session allocates new CPU and RAM resources that don't get cleared by default or by garbage collector. In Eliza's code, we are calling this, again and again, basically ram usage became directly proportional to the no of lines in the character's file knowledge.\r\n\r\n```\r\nelizaLogger.debug(\"Initializing BGE embedding model...\");\r\n\r\nconst embeddingModel = await FlagEmbedding.init({\r\n    cacheDir: cacheDir,\r\n    model: EmbeddingModel.BGESmallENV15,\r\n    // BGE-small-en-v1.5 specific settings\r\n    maxLength: 512, // BGE's context window\r\n});\r\n\r\nelizaLogger.debug(\"Generating embedding for input:\", {\r\n    inputLength: input.length,\r\n    inputPreview: input.slice(0, 100) + \"...\",\r\n});\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhile this could be fixed in FastEmbed js by updating onnxruntime-node and using its release() method, that approach needs more testing and planning. This PR provides a quick and reliable fix by ensuring we create only one model instance.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nImprovements (optimizing existing features for better performance)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation as this is an internal optimization that doesn't affect the API or user interface.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review the newly added `EmbeddingModelManager.ts`\r\n2. Check the modifications in `embedding.ts` where the local embedding logic has been updated\r\n3. Monitor RAM usage during character knowledge processing\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Process a character file with substantial knowledge content\r\n   - Verify that RAM usage remains under 1GB\r\n   - Confirm that embeddings are still generated correctly\r\n2. Test concurrent embedding requests\r\n   - Verify that race conditions are handled properly\r\n   - Check that model initialization happens only once\r\n3. Test browser fallback\r\n   - Verify that the code still falls back to remote embedding in browser environments\r\n\r\n# Test Results\r\n### Before\r\nRAM Usage: 8-12GB during character knowledge processing\r\n\r\n### After\r\nRAM Usage: <1GB during character knowledge processing\r\n\r\n# Technical Implementation Details\r\n- Implemented singleton pattern for BGE model management\r\n- Added proper initialization locking to handle concurrent requests\r\n- Maintained existing fallback behavior and error handling\r\n- Added cleanup capabilities for proper resource management\r\n- No changes to the embedding API or external interfaces\r\n\r\nThe PR introduces two main files:\r\n1. `EmbeddingModelManager.ts` - New singleton class managing model initialization\r\n2. Modified `embedding.ts` - Updated to use the manager for local embeddings\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nNo special deployment steps required. The changes are backwards compatible and will take effect automatically after deployment.\r\n\r\nLet me know your thoughts or if you need any clarification or changes to the PR!",

            "body": "**Describe the bug**\r\n\r\nWhen more than 50-54 memory items are created within the same room ID, the `composeContext` function occasionally omits certain memories, leading to incomplete state data. This issue occurs when using the SQLite adapter. Note that I have not tested this with the other database adapters available, but I would be surprised if an SQLite database cannot handle more than 50 records within the memories table.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\nSteps to reproduce the behavior:\r\n\r\n1. Clone the repository:\r\n   ```\r\n   git clone git@github.com:Sifchain/sa-eliza.git\r\n   ```\r\n2. Checkout the branch `realitySpiral/testUsefulWorkflows` (based on the `develop` branch from the upstream eliza repository):\r\n   ```\r\n   git checkout realitySpiral/testUsefulWorkflows\r\n   ```\r\n3. Set the following `.env` variables:\r\n   ```\r\n   GITHUB_API_TOKEN=ghp_XXX\r\n\r\n   GITHUB_OWNER=sifchain\r\n   GITHUB_REPO=sa-eliza\r\n   GITHUB_BRANCH=sif-dev\r\n\r\n   GITHUB_ISSUES_LIMIT=100\r\n   GITHUB_PULL_REQUESTS_LIMIT=100\r\n   ```\r\n   Refer to [this guide](https://github.com/Sifchain/sa-eliza/blob/realitySpiral/testUsefulWorkflows/docs/docs/packages/plugins.md#12-github-plugin-elizaplugin-github) for generating and using the GitHub API token.\r\n\r\n4. Install dependencies and start the agent:\r\n   ```\r\n   pnpm install -r\r\n   rm -rf agent/data && pnpm build && pnpm start --character=characters/staff-engineer.character.json\r\n   ```\r\n5. Observe the logs. At some point, you will notice the following:\r\n   ```\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Executing handler for action: INITIALIZE_REPOSITORY\"]\r\n\r\n   \u25ce LOGS\r\n     [initializeRepository] Composing state for message:\r\n     {\"id\":\"6a74eb9e-2eb1-00b7-bce3-a2d819d53bd5\",\"userId\":\"e0705f05-5af9-0ac4-80b9-a55815900197\",\"agentId\":\"b1ccf0ce-60b8-00ed-8da1-0fd7b791d233\",\"content\":{\"text\":\"No memories found, starting to initialize repository and create memories.\",\"action\":\"NOTHING\",\"source\":\"github\",\"inReplyTo\":\"3b2b2818-d716-08b7-a767-418a416a89c7\"},\"roomId\":\"a5e95f21-99e3-0354-add8-79108740b31a\",\"createdAt\":1736270012868}\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Initializing repository realityspiral/test on branch main...\"]\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Repository path: /tmp/elizaos-repos/realityspiral/test\"]\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Repos directory already exists: /tmp/elizaos-repos/realityspiral\"]\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Cloning or pulling repository realityspiral/test... @ branch: main\"]\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 URL: https://github.com/realityspiral/test.git @ branch: main\"]\r\n   ```\r\n   The repository information (`realityspiral/test`) is incorrect.\r\n\r\n6. Update the `.env` file to reduce memory storage limits:\r\n   ```\r\n   GITHUB_ISSUES_LIMIT=10\r\n   GITHUB_PULL_REQUESTS_LIMIT=10\r\n   ```\r\n7. Restart the agent:\r\n   ```\r\n   rm -rf agent/data && pnpm build && pnpm start --character=characters/staff-engineer.character.json\r\n   ```\r\n8. Observe the logs again. This time, the correct repository information is used:\r\n   ```\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Executing handler for action: INITIALIZE_REPOSITORY\"]\r\n\r\n   \u25ce LOGS\r\n     [initializeRepository] Composing state for message:\r\n     {\"id\":\"53d09a5a-289e-03d6-a49e-0fb655fe55c2\",\"userId\":\"41b1749c-25aa-0dc6-9cdf-cf3a1141fc55\",\"agentId\":\"b1ccf0ce-60b8-00ed-8da1-0fd7b791d233\",\"content\":{\"text\":\"No memories found, starting to initialize repository and create memories.\",\"action\":\"NOTHING\",\"source\":\"github\",\"inReplyTo\":\"3b2b2818-d716-08b7-a767-418a416a89c7\"},\"roomId\":\"a5e95f21-99e3-0354-add8-79108740b31a\",\"createdAt\":1736270165808}\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Initializing repository sifchain/sa-eliza on branch sif-dev...\"]\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Repository path: /tmp/elizaos-repos/sifchain/sa-eliza\"]\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Repos directory already exists: /tmp/elizaos-repos/sifchain\"]\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Cloning or pulling repository sifchain/sa-eliza... @ branch: sif-dev\"]\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 URL: https://github.com/sifchain/sa-eliza.git @ branch: sif-dev\"]\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Checking out branch sif-dev in repository /tmp/elizaos-repos/sifchain/sa-eliza\"]\r\n\r\n   [\"\\u2139 Repository initialized successfully! URL: https://github.com/sifchain/sa-eliza @ branch: sif-dev\"]\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nThe `composeContext` function should include all relevant memories without omitting any, regardless of the number of items stored in memory. Additionally, the correct repository information should always be used.\r\n\r\n**Screenshots**\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n- This issue appears to be tied to the SQLite adapter\u2019s handling of large memory sets.\r\n- Reducing the memory limits in the `.env` file mitigates the issue but does not resolve the underlying problem.\r\n- This behavior could impact other functionalities relying on the `composeContext` function if memory limits are exceeded.",
