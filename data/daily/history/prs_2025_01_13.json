    "body": "# Relates to\r\n\r\n<!-- LINK TO ISSUE OR TICKET -->\r\n\r\nThis PR does not relate to a specific issue but introduces multiple enhancements and optimizations to the Supabase database adapter.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\n**Risk Level:** Low\r\n\r\n**Potential Impact:**\r\n- Changes primarily focus on **query optimizations** and **error handling improvements**.\r\n- Possible risks include **unexpected query behavior** or **edge cases not previously encountered**.\r\n- Requires verification that caching, memory queries, and relationship management work as expected.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR introduces several improvements and optimizations to the `SupabaseDatabaseAdapter` in `packages/adapter-supabase/src/index.ts`. The key changes include:\r\n\r\n- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved logging and structured error messages for better debugging.\r\n- **Query Optimization**: Refactored how memory tables are queried dynamically based on embedding size.\r\n- **More Robust `getMemoryById` Implementation**: Now iterates through potential memory tables instead of assuming a single table.\r\n- **Ensuring Unique Entries in Relationships**: Improved relationship handling by checking for existing rooms before creating new ones.\r\n- **More Efficient Memory Creation**: Includes validation for embedding sizes and converts timestamps properly.\r\n- **Caching for Knowledge Search**: Implements a caching mechanism to improve performance.\r\n- **Better Handling of `maybeSingle()`**: Uses `maybeSingle()` in cases where a single record is expected, avoiding unnecessary errors.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n- **Improvements**: Various optimizations and refactoring of existing logic.\r\n- **Bug Fixes**: Ensuring better error handling and database query robustness.\r\n- **Features**: Adds caching and improves relationship consistency management.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n- **My changes do not require a change to the project documentation.**\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. **Review `SupabaseDatabaseAdapter.ts`** in `packages/adapter-supabase/src/index.ts`.\r\n2. **Check changes to `getMemoryById`, `createMemory`, `getRoomsForParticipants`, and `searchKnowledge` methods.**\r\n3. **Verify SQL queries have been optimized** (dynamic memory table selection, better relationship checks, etc.).\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. **Run automated tests** to verify that the database queries execute correctly.\r\n2. **Manually test the caching logic** by searching knowledge (`searchKnowledge()`) and checking if cache retrieval works.\r\n3. **Check new logging improvements** by inducing intentional errors (e.g., incorrect queries) and confirming structured error messages.\r\n4. **Verify memory creation** for various embedding sizes (`384, 768, 1024, 1536`).\r\n5. **Confirm room creation logic** properly reuses existing rooms between users rather than duplicating them.\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\n- You must run the schema.sql file in the supabase SQL editor.  You will also need to add the functions to supabase via the SQL editor.  I have the functions in my dump file.  I will need to add them to the schema.sql file.\r\n\r\n# Database changes\r\n\r\n- No schema changes, but **queries have been optimized** to select the appropriate memory tables dynamically.\r\n\r\n# Deployment instructions\r\n\r\n- Standard deployment process.\r\n- Ensure all database queries are tested before merging.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n4n7m4n\r\n",

    "body": "Here's a draft PR description for the changes:\r\n\r\n# Twitter Client EVM Transaction Support & New Character Integration\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR refactors the Twitter client to:\r\n\r\n1. Add support for monitoring and responding to EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchain transactions\r\n2. Improve tweet generation logic to handle target user filtering\r\n3. Add better error handling and logging around tweet processing\r\n\r\nKey changes:\r\n```typescript:packages/client-twitter/src/post.ts\r\nconst targetUsers = this.client.twitterConfig.TWITTER_TARGET_USERS;\r\nconst targetTweets = tweets.filter(tweet =>\r\n    targetUsers.some(user => \r\n        tweet.username.toLowerCase() === user.toLowerCase()\r\n    )\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- Adds EVM transaction monitoring capability\r\n- Makes target user filtering configurable\r\n- Improves tweet generation workflow\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nMedium:\r\n- Changes to core tweet generation logic could affect existing character behavior\r\n- New EVM transaction monitoring needs proper error handling\r\n- Target user filtering needs validation to prevent empty target lists\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the changes in `packages/client-twitter/src/post.ts`\r\n2. Check the target user filtering logic\r\n3. Verify error handling for EVM transaction monitoring\r\n\r\n### Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Configure target users in environment:\r\n```env\r\nTWITTER_TARGET_USERS=user1,user2,user3\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Start client and verify logs show:\r\n```\r\n- Target Users: user1,user2,user3\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Check tweet generation only processes tweets from configured users:\r\n```\r\nNo tweets from target users (user1, user2, user3) to process\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Verify EVM transaction monitoring (if enabled):\r\n```\r\nMonitoring transactions for addresses: [addresses]\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes - need to add:\r\n- Configuration options for target users\r\n- EVM transaction monitoring setup\r\n- New character template using EVM capabilities\r\n\r\n## Deploy Notes\r\n\r\nNew environment variables required:\r\n```\r\nTWITTER_TARGET_USERS=comma,separated,usernames\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n0x_sero\r\n\r\n",

[CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):\n\n> ‼️ **IMPORTANT**\n> Auto-reply has been disabled for this repository in the CodeRabbit settings. The CodeRabbit bot will not respond to your replies unless it is explicitly tagged.\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Add support for monitoring and responding to EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchain transactions\r\n2. Improve tweet generation logic to handle target user filtering\r\n3. Add better error handling and logging around tweet processing\r\n\r\nKey changes:\r\n```typescript:packages/client-twitter/src/post.ts\r\nconst targetUsers = this.client.twitterConfig.TWITTER_TARGET_USERS;\r\nconst targetTweets = tweets.filter(tweet =>\r\n    targetUsers.some(user => \r\n        tweet.username.toLowerCase() === user.toLowerCase()\r\n    )\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- Adds EVM transaction monitoring capability\r\n- Makes target user filtering configurable\r\n- Improves tweet generation workflow\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nMedium:\r\n- Changes to core tweet generation logic could affect existing character behavior\r\n- New EVM transaction monitoring needs proper error handling\r\n- Target user filtering needs validation to prevent empty target lists\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1.

Add support for monitoring and responding to EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) blockchain transactions\r\n2. Improve tweet generation logic to handle target user filtering\r\n3. Add better error handling and logging around tweet processing\r\n\r\nKey changes:\r\n```typescript:packages/client-twitter/src/post.ts\r\nconst targetUsers = this.client.twitterConfig.TWITTER_TARGET_USERS;\r\nconst targetTweets = tweets.filter(tweet =>\r\n    targetUsers.some(user => \r\n        tweet.username.toLowerCase() === user.toLowerCase()\r\n    )\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- Adds EVM transaction monitoring capability\r\n- Makes target user filtering configurable\r\n- Improves tweet generation workflow\r\n\r\n## Risks\r\n\r\nMedium:\r\n- Changes to core tweet generation logic could affect existing character behavior\r\n- New EVM transaction monitoring needs proper error handling\r\n- Target user filtering needs validation to prevent empty target lists\r\n\r\n## Testing\r\n\r\n### Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1.

    "body": "# Relates to\r\nImproving test infrastructure and type safety in Twitter client tests\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow - Most changes are isolated to test files. The only production code change is setting TWITTER_MAX_TWEETS_PER_DAY to default to 10 tweets per day if not specified. This maintains existing behavior as seen in tests.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- Keep env property in test runtime mocks for better real-world simulation\r\n- Add TestAgentRuntime type to handle type safety in test mocks without implementing full IAgentRuntime interface (30+ properties)\r\n- Remove duplicate TWITTER_MAX_TWEET_LENGTH in favor of MAX_TWEET_LENGTH\r\n- Add TWITTER_MAX_TWEETS_PER_DAY to schema with default value of 10 tweets per day\r\n- Standardize mock configuration across test files\r\n- Fix type casting issues in environment tests\r\n\r\nThis change improves type safety while maintaining realistic test scenarios and reduces test complexity by only mocking necessary runtime properties.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. packages/client-twitter/__tests__/environment.test.ts\r\n2. packages/client-twitter/__tests__/base.test.ts\r\n3. packages/client-twitter/__tests__/post.test.ts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n- Run the Twitter client tests:\r\n  ```bash\r\n  cd packages/client-twitter\r\n  pnpm test\r\n  ```\r\n- Verify all Twitter client tests pass\r\n- Check that mock configurations are consistent across test files\r\n- Verify the build succeeds:\r\n  ```bash\r\n  cd packages/client-twitter\r\n  pnpm build\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nwizardsupreme",

[CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):\n\n> ‼️ **IMPORTANT**\n> Auto-reply has been disabled for this repository in the CodeRabbit settings. The CodeRabbit bot will not respond to your replies unless it is explicitly tagged.\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

(Beta)\n\n<!-- finishing_touch_checkbox_end -->\n<!-- tips_start -->\n\n---\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>🪧 Tips</summary>\n\n### Chat\n\nThere are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):\n\n> ‼️ **IMPORTANT**\n> Auto-reply has been disabled for this repository in the CodeRabbit settings. The CodeRabbit bot will not respond to your replies unless it is explicitly tagged.\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"
