In twitter client when i put gemini api key in character.json . this api key wont get used for text or tweet generations. it always falls back to one i provide in .env resulting api key exhaustion.\r\n2. twitter agent filters out all the relevant tweet on which she can reply or retweet and then she replies all of then in an instant which leads to rate limit and flags our account as spam.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n1. put modelProvider as \"google\" and put your GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY in secrets.\r\n2. put more TWITTER_TARGET_USERS so that it may gather more and more tweets to interact with.\r\n\r\n{\r\n  \"name\": \"XYZ AI Agent\",\r\n  \"clients\": [\r\n    \"twitter\"\r\n  ],\r\n  \"modelProvider\": \"google\",\r\n  \"settings\": {\r\n    \"secrets\": {\r\n      \"GOOGLE_GENERATIVE_AI_API_KEY\":\"AIza...\",\r\n      \"TWITTER_USERNAME\": \"username...\",\r\n      \"TWITTER_PASSWORD\": \"password...\",\r\n      \"TWITTER_EMAIL\": \"xyz@gmail.com\",\r\n      \"TWITTER_TARGET_USERS\": \"@solana,@ai16zdao,...\"\r\n    },\r\n  },\r\n  ....\r\n}\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\n1.

I included 1773's commits but 1382 was too different and too many commits to include. This plugin adds 3 new price data APIs. It first looks for Coingecko API key, then CoinMarketCap & and if neither are present it falls back to CoinCap.io's free API.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nAdds price retrieval via the GET_PRICE action.\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2beebadd-bf52-4a05-b70f-979def9fe5cf)\r\n\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there are no linked issues explaining why. If there is a related issue, it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Why are we doing this?

This will really help if the PR needs to be retested and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nReview plugin files (they are short and simple)\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nAdd an API key if you have one (check .env.example), if not it will default to CoinCap.io API (which does have less coins but works well). CoinGecko API is recommended, CoinMarketCap also an option. All confirmed to be working.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.
