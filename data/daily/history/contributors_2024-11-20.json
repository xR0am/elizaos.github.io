This is a database schema change but only adds functionality without modifying existing structures.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nAdds the `fuzzystrmatch` PostgreSQL extension to the database schema. This extension provides several functions for determining similarities between strings and fuzzy string matching.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation, as this is an infrastructure-level change that doesn't affect application interfaces.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review the schema.sql file in packages/adapter-postgres\r\n2. Verify the fuzzystrmatch extension installation in a test database\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Create a fresh test database\r\n2. Run the schema.sql migration\r\n3. Verify the fuzzystrmatch extension is installed by running:\r\n```sql\r\nSELECT * FROM pg_extension WHERE extname = 'fuzzystrmatch';\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n## Database changes\r\n- Requires PostgreSQL with fuzzystrmatch extension available\r\n- Schema change: `CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS fuzzystrmatch;`\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\nStandard deployment process applies:\r\n1. Ensure the PostgreSQL server has fuzzystrmatch extension available\r\n2. Run schema migrations as normal",

The changes include:\r\n1. Explicitly setting the bot to undeafened and unmuted when joining voice channels\r\n2. Improved voice connection cleanup by clearing streams and monitors when destroying old connections\r\n3. Added error handling for voice connections\r\n4. Refactored voice channel join logic to use VoiceManager instead of direct joinVoiceChannel calls\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nBug fix (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review the changes in `packages/client-discord/src/actions/joinvoice.ts` where joinVoiceChannel calls are replaced with state.voiceManager\r\n2. Check the new voice connection setup in `packages/client-discord/src/voice.ts`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. As a user, invite the bot to a Discord server\r\n2. Join a voice channel\r\n3. Make the bot join the same voice channel\r\n4. Verify that:\r\n   - The bot joins successfully\r\n   - The bot is not deafened by default\r\n   - The bot is not muted by default\r\n   - The bot can properly hear and process voice input from users\r\n\r\nThe automated tests should be updated to verify this behaviour remains consistent.",

The SDK provides a more developer-friendly experience with:\r\n\r\n- Improved TypeScript support\r\n- More concise and readable API\r\n- Maintained wrapper around the core package functionality\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n- Replace `unruggable-core` dependency with `unruggable-sdk`\r\n- Update relevant implementations to use the new SDK interface\r\n- Update types where necessary\r\n\r\n## Benefits\r\n- Better developer experience through improved typing\r\n- More maintainable code through cleaner abstractions\r\n- Same core functionality with a more ergonomic interface",
