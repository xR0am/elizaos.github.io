This relates to this issue: https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues/206\r\n\r\nIf you add overrides to your character file, it will use these templates in place of the templates that are in the code. Obviously how the templates work and what they are is opaque, and will require looking into the code for them. Fortunately, the template variable names are the same as the overrides.\r\n\r\nWe should add documentation and some kind of tutorial / explanation of templates and how to modify them, but for now lets get this in so our partners can use it.",

So when clicking this, I was not expecting to see setup instructions. It seems like this is mostly duplicate info from the \"[Getting Started](https://ai16z.github.io/eliza/docs/quickstart/)\" section. There isn't really an API, so I'd suggest we just remove this section for now.\n* Possibly replace with with some documentation about how the core information flows from the Agent Runtime, to the Memory System, the Room-based Organization, Information Processing Pipeline, Provider Integration, and State Management - though these could all be valid sections under the Advanced Concepts section as well on the Documentation page.\n\n![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/55c6d401-9b6b-4f49-90f7-528ffb4acefb)\n*  banner image is broken\n",
