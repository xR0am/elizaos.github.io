Added multichain support, the current version of the plugin only supported mainnet and Base, and there have been several requests for additional EVM chain support.\r\n\r\n- The plugin lacked test coverage, so we initiated tests alongside the feature development, starting with WalletProvider.\r\n- Refactored the plugin to make it more test-friendly and modular.\r\n- Added multichain support (for viem chains)\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Improvements: Refactoring, cleaning, and testing of the existing plugin.\r\n- Features: Non-breaking changes to add EVM multichain support. The previous character configuration even though accepted evm chain config array, but in fact it was not implemented \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nInitially, the goal was to add IoTeX EVM chain support. However, the scope was expanded to include general multichain support, given the demand for broader compatibility. Transfers are not yet fully functional, as noted in [Issue #735](https://github.com/ai16z/eliza/issues/735). This will be addressed in a follow-up PR.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\nCurrently, the project documentation does not cover blockchain configurations, including EVM plugin setup. No changes are required at this time.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## How was it tested\r\n\r\n- Ran test scripts \r\n- Verified functionality through agent interactions:\r\n<img width=\"627\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-06 at 2 42 13\u202fAM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a99dea38-560f-46e4-8826-4e98be175486\">\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nFile: packages/plugin-evm/src/tests/wallet.test.ts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nNo manual testing is required; automated tests have been implemented and cover the new functionality.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nnikita_zhou",

This PR focuses on enabling multichain support and making the plugin more test-friendly via TDD + a foundation to extend the plugin with more features.\n\nThe GOAT plugin does look interesting, and I\u2019ll take a closer look to see if it aligns with the goals here.\n\nLet me know if you think it\u2019s better to pivot entirely to GOAT, or if continuing with this plugin (and fixing the mentioned issues) is a good path forward!"

This results in unnecessary API calls, which could potentially trigger rate limits or cause inefficient resource usage.\r\n\r\n**To Reproduce**\r\n\r\n1.\tRun the Twitter login script with valid cookies already present.\r\n2.\tObserve that the login function is still executed, even though the user is technically logged in.\r\n\r\n**Expected behavior**\r\n\r\nIf valid cookies exist and the user is already logged in, the script should skip the login process and proceed directly to caching the cookies or other subsequent steps.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n1.\tChecking for cookies and logged-in status before attempting login.\r\n2.\tIntroducing a retry mechanism with a limit of 5 attempts to avoid infinite loops.\r\n3. \tLogging detailed errors and outcomes for easier debugging.",

            "body": "# Add Slack Integration for Eliza AI Agent\r\n\r\n## Overview\r\nThis PR adds a new Slack client integration for the Eliza AI agent, enabling seamless communication between Slack workspaces and the Eliza AI system. The integration includes robust message handling, conversation management, and standalone example scripts for easy testing and deployment.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n- Full Slack bot integration with event handling and message management\r\n- Message deduplication system to prevent duplicate responses\r\n- Thread-aware conversation handling\r\n- Support for attachments and media files\r\n- Conversation summarization capabilities\r\n- Standalone example scripts for testing and development\r\n\r\n## Example Scripts\r\nThe package includes several standalone scripts in `packages/client-slack/src/examples/`:\r\n\r\n1. **standalone-example.ts**\r\n   - Basic bot setup and connection\r\n   - Demonstrates message sending, threading, and image attachments\r\n   - Includes error handling and port management\r\n\r\n2. **standalone-summarize.ts**\r\n   - Shows conversation summarization capabilities\r\n   - Demonstrates handling attachments and threaded discussions\r\n\r\n3. **standalone-attachment.ts**\r\n   - Comprehensive attachment handling\r\n   - File upload and sharing capabilities\r\n\r\n## Setup and Configuration\r\n### 1. Slack App Creation\r\n![Slack App Creation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AIFlowML/eliza_aiflow/add-slack-plugin/packages/client-slack/src/examples/sc_01.png)\r\n- Create a new Slack app using the provided manifest\r\n- Configure bot permissions and event subscriptions\r\n\r\n### 2. Bot Configuration\r\n![Bot Configuration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AIFlowML/eliza_aiflow/add-slack-plugin/packages/client-slack/src/examples/sc_02.png)\r\n- Set up OAuth scopes and bot token\r\n- Configure event subscriptions and interactive components\r\n\r\n## Testing Instructions\r\n### Running Example Scripts\r\n1. Set up environment variables in `.env`:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   SLACK_APP_ID=your_app_id\r\n   SLACK_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id\r\n   SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret\r\n   SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=your_signing_secret\r\n   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token\r\n   SLACK_VERIFICATION_TOKEN=your_verification_token\r\n   SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=test_channel_id\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Run the basic example:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   ts-node packages/client-slack/src/examples/standalone-example.ts\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. Test summarization:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   ts-node packages/client-slack/src/examples/standalone-summarize.ts\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. Try attachment handling:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   ts-node packages/client-slack/src/examples/standalone-attachment.ts\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Verifying Integration\r\n1. Start a new conversation with the bot\r\n2. Test direct mentions and thread replies\r\n3. Try uploading files and requesting summaries\r\n4. Verify message handling in different channel types (DM, public, private)\r\n\r\n## Technical Details\r\n- TypeScript-based implementation with full type safety\r\n- Event-driven architecture for message handling\r\n- Built-in error handling and logging\r\n- Configurable message deduplication\r\n- Extensible provider system for easy customization\r\n\r\n## Documentation\r\n- Full setup guide in README.md\r\n- Example scripts with inline documentation\r\n- Type definitions for all public APIs\r\n- Environment configuration guide\r\n\r\n## Checklist\r\n- [x] TypeScript implementation with full type coverage\r\n- [x] Comprehensive example scripts\r\n- [x] Setup screenshots and documentation\r\n- [x] Error handling and logging\r\n- [x] Message deduplication system\r\n- [x] Thread awareness\r\n- [x] Attachment handling\r\n- [x] Environment validation\r\n- [x] Testing instructions",

There was no specification on the pnpm version and even though I had all the other versions correctly, I was getting the same constant error. \r\n\r\nThe project requires specific versions of pnpm (9+?) as defined in the package.json, but when trying to install dependencies, I kept getting ERR_PNPM_META_FETCH_FAIL errors and broken lockfile warnings.\r\n\r\nThe root cause was a mismatch between my system's pnpm version and the one specified in the project.\r\n\r\nSolution\r\n\r\nUsing nvm + corepack solved the issue. After fixing this on my end, I'm adding this documentation to improve experience!\r\n\r\n'''\r\n   corepack enable\r\n   corepack prepare pnpm@9.12.3 --activate\r\n'''\r\n\r\nHelped me solve the issue.",
