Add a \"Build Local Libraries\" Step:**\r\nIncluded the `pnpm build` step in the quickstart guide to address an issue where running pnpm start would fail due to missing imported libraries. This ensures the project is properly built before starting.\r\n\r\n**2. Improve better-sqlite3 Troubleshooting Instructions:**\r\n\r\nAdded `pnpm store prune` as a troubleshooting step for resolving issues with better-sqlite3.\r\n\r\nDeleting the pnpm-lock.yaml file is unnecessary since the library versions remain consistent. The root cause is related to the `pnpm` cache retaining an incompatible version of the package, which occurs when using a different Node.js version during the initial installation.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nImprove docs\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nGot stuck while following the quickstart, saw other people had the same problem.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\naguspunk\r\n",
