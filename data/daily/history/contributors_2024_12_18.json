It ensures that o1 is properly linked, documented, and accessible for future reference.\r\n\r\nWhat kind of change is this? Improvements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n\r\nDocumentation changes needed? My changes require a change to the project documentation. I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n\r\nTesting\r\n\r\nWhere should a reviewer start? Begin by reviewing the integration points in code where o1 references have been added. Check the documentation updates to confirm consistent explanations.\r\n\r\nDetailed testing steps:\r\n\r\nReview the codebase changes where o1 is introduced.\r\nConfirm that references to o1 are correct, properly linked, and that no compilation or runtime errors occur.\r\nReview the updated documentation to ensure it reflects the new o1 integration context and instructions for usage.",

No Way...But how?? The pkgs specifically lists `nodejs_23` and when I run `node version` I will see the `v23.2.0`, but that still does not equal `v20.18.1`.\r\n\r\nSo I did some digging bc Nix can be a pain in the ass at times with weird dependencies errors. So I checked the `pnpm` pkgs source code and found this line https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/394571358ce82dff7411395829aa6a3aad45b907/pkgs/development/tools/pnpm/generic.nix#L28\r\n\r\nAnd `nodejs` pkg points to:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e258b67-924e-4471-a590-d7bde3ac7c64)\r\n\r\nSo this here is the culprit for why a NixOS user will hit this weird error even though we declaratively chose the right node version."

            "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nWhen trying to build a pnpm monorepo using Nix's buildNpmPackage that includes git dependencies (specifically @discordjs/opus), the build fails due to git access restrictions in the Nix build environment. The current workarounds involve either modifying package.json or pre-fetching git dependencies, both of which are not ideal solutions for maintaining the project.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nA built-in way to handle git dependencies in buildNpmPackage that:\r\n\r\n 1. Automatically fetches git dependencies using fetchgit during the build process\r\n 2. Maintains compatibility with pnpm workspaces and monorepo structure\r\n 3. Preserves the original package.json without requiring modifications\r\n 4. Works with trusted dependencies in pnpm\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n1. Manually pre-fetching git dependencies and placing them in node_modules\r\n2. Modifying package.json to use published versions instead of git dependencies\r\n3. Using mkDerivation instead of buildNpmPackage to handle the build process manually\r\n4. Creating a custom derivation to handle git dependencies before the main build\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nThis issue particularly affects projects using Discord.js and similar packages that rely on git dependencies for native modules. The current workarounds either break the development workflow or require maintaining separate package configurations for Nix builds.\r\nExample of a failing build: \r\n\r\n`ERR_PNPM_LOCKFILE_CONFIG_MISMATCH Cannot proceed with the frozen installation. The current \"overrides\" configuration doesn't match the value found in the lockfile`\r\n",
