Specifically, the errors occur because the `Plugin` type does not include a `clients` property.\r\n\r\nThe following errors are observed:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsrc/index.ts:206:24 - error TS2339: Property 'clients' does not exist on type 'Plugin'.\r\n\r\n206             if (plugin.clients) {\r\n                           ~~~~~~~\r\n\r\nsrc/index.ts:207:45 - error TS2339: Property 'clients' does not exist on type 'Plugin'.\r\n\r\n207                 for (const client of plugin.clients) {\r\n                                                ~~~~~~~\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue seems to originate from an outdated or incorrect type definition for `Plugin`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **To Reproduce**\r\n1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.\r\n2. Run the following commands:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   pnpm install\r\n   pnpm start --characters=\"characters/character.character.json\"\r\n   ```\r\n3. Observe the TypeScript build errors.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### **Expected behavior**\r\nThe project should successfully build and start without errors. Type definitions for `Plugin` should include the `clients` property, or the code should handle cases where `clients` is not defined.\r\n",

New environment variable pattern: `CHARACTER.YOUR_CHARACTER_NAME.SETTING_NAME`\r\n2. Automatic handling of spaces in character names (converted to underscores)\r\n3. Enhanced settings hierarchy:\r\n   - Character-specific namespaced env variables (highest priority)\r\n   - Character settings from JSON\r\n   - Global environment variables\r\n   - Default values\r\n4. Maintains backward compatibility with existing settings system\r\n\r\nKey changes:\r\n- Modified settings loader in `packages/core/src/settings.ts`\r\n- Updated character loading in `packages/agent/src/index.ts`\r\n- Added automatic conversion of character name spaces to underscores\r\n\r\n### Documentation Updates\r\nUpdated documentation to reflect the new feature:\r\n1. Added namespaced settings pattern to secrets management guide\r\n2. Updated configuration guide with new examples\r\n3. Updated agent package documentation with hierarchy explanation\r\n4. Added clear examples for both .env and character.json methods\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nYes - Documentation has been updated to reflect the new feature:\r\n- Added namespaced settings pattern\r\n- Updated configuration examples\r\n- Updated settings hierarchy explanation\r\n- Added character name handling instructions\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n### Feature Testing\r\n1. Review code changes:\r\n   - `packages/core/src/settings.ts`\r\n   - `packages/agent/src/index.ts`\r\n\r\n2. Test functionality:\r\n   ```env\r\n   # Test with simple name\r\n   CHARACTER.TESTBOT.OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-test\r\n   \r\n   # Test with spaces in name\r\n   CHARACTER.MY_TEST_BOT.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-other\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n### Documentation Testing\r\nReview updated docs:\r\n- docs/docs/guides/secrets-management.md\r\n- docs/docs/guides/configuration.md\r\n- docs/docs/packages/agent.md\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Feature Testing:\r\n   - Create character with spaces in name\r\n   - Add namespaced variables to .env\r\n   - Verify correct loading into character settings\r\n   - Test precedence over character.json settings\r\n   - Verify backward compatibility\r\n   - Test global fallback behavior\r\n\r\n2.
