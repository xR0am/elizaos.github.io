The token contract plugin is only enabled when proper Coinbase credentials are present.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR adds a new Coinbase token contract plugin that enables:\r\n1. Deployment of ERC20, ERC721, and ERC1155 token contracts\r\n2. Interaction with deployed smart contracts through method invocation\r\n3. Automatic logging of contract deployments and interactions to CSV files\r\n4. Integration with existing Coinbase wallet management system\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n- Adds new token contract deployment capabilities\r\n- Adds contract interaction functionality\r\n- Extends existing Coinbase plugin suite\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\n- Added comprehensive documentation for the token contract plugin in `docs/docs/packages/plugins.md`\r\n- Updated plugin documentation with new features and usage examples\r\n- Added configuration instructions and best practices\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review the token contract plugin implementation:\r\n   - `packages/plugin-coinbase/src/plugins/tokenContract.ts`\r\n   - `packages/plugin-coinbase/src/types.ts` (new token contract types)\r\n   - `packages/plugin-coinbase/src/templates.ts` (new templates)\r\n\r\n2. Review the integration:\r\n   - `agent/src/index.ts` (plugin initialization)\r\n   - `packages/plugin-coinbase/src/index.ts` (plugin exports)\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Configure Coinbase credentials:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   export COINBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key\r\n   export COINBASE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Test ERC20 token deployment:\r\n   ```typescript\r\n   await runtime.triggerAction(\"DEPLOY_TOKEN_CONTRACT\", {\r\n     contractType: \"ERC20\",\r\n     name: \"TestToken\",\r\n     symbol: \"TST\",\r\n     network: \"base\",\r\n     totalSupply: 1000000\r\n   });\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n3. Test ERC721 (NFT) deployment:\r\n   ```typescript\r\n   await runtime.triggerAction(\"DEPLOY_TOKEN_CONTRACT\", {\r\n     contractType: \"ERC721\",\r\n     name: \"TestNFT\",\r\n     symbol: \"TNFT\",\r\n     network: \"eth\",\r\n     baseURI: \"https://api.test.com/metadata/\"\r\n   });\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n4. Test contract interaction:\r\n   ```typescript\r\n   await runtime.triggerAction(\"INVOKE_CONTRACT\", {\r\n     contractAddress: \"0x123...\",\r\n     method: \"transfer\",\r\n     abi: [...],\r\n     args: {\r\n       to: \"0x456...\",\r\n       amount: \"1000000000000000000\"\r\n     },\r\n     network: \"base\"\r\n   });\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n5. Verify CSV logging:\r\n   - Check `contracts.csv` for deployment records\r\n   - Verify transaction details are properly logged\r\n\r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1q5ezLF6KOgJdQ6x04m_lStiO2Y-jzCEq/view?usp=sharing \r\n\r\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1cFK9RbxTw7GaD3J0sfxva0t4UIuZrmpQ/view?usp=sharing\r\n\r\n## Files changed:\r\n1. `packages/plugin-coinbase/src/plugins/tokenContract.ts` (new)\r\n2. `packages/plugin-coinbase/src/types.ts` (updated)\r\n3. `packages/plugin-coinbase/src/templates.ts` (updated)\r\n4. `packages/plugin-coinbase/src/index.ts` (updated)\r\n5. `agent/src/index.ts` (updated)\r\n6. `docs/docs/packages/plugins.md` (updated)\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nNo special deployment steps required. The plugin is automatically enabled when Coinbase credentials are present.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nN/A",

It allows real-time updates and actions based on cryptocurrency transactions, enhancing the system's dynamic capabilities.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n- **Feature**: Adds new functionality to create, manage, and retrieve Coinbase webhooks for cryptocurrency events.\r\n- **Improvement**: Provides support for seamless integration with the Coinbase SDK.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n- **Yes**:\r\n  - Update the project documentation to include instructions on configuring and testing the Coinbase Webhook Plugin.\r\n  - Add a section detailing supported event types and example webhook payloads.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Testing:\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review the `CREATE_WEBHOOK` and `webhookProvider` functionality for accurate event handling and API interactions.\r\n2. Verify the implementation of error-handling and security measures (e.g., webhook secret validation).\r\n\r\n\r\nScreengrab: \r\n<img width=\"1155\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-05 at 8 30 38\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0122a7c7-fa8e-4cb6-be85-2a870000eff0\">\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps:\r\n1. **Testing Webhook Creation**:\r\n   - Use a public testing service like [[Webhook.site](https://webhook.site/)](https://webhook.site) to create a webhook URL.\r\n   - Replace the `notificationUri` field in the example code with the generated URL.\r\n   - Run the `CREATE_WEBHOOK` action and validate the response.\r\n\r\n2. **Testing Webhook Listing**:\r\n   - Trigger the `webhookProvider` action to fetch and log existing webhooks.\r\n   - Cross-check the response data with Coinbase's CDP portal to ensure consistency.\r\n\r\n3. **Error Scenarios**:\r\n   - Test webhook creation with invalid inputs (e.g., invalid network ID or event type) and confirm appropriate error responses.\r\n\r\n4. **Security Validation**:\r\n   - Verify the webhook secret is securely stored and not exposed in logs or public code.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes:\r\n- Deploy as part of the Eliza core runtime update.\r\n- Ensure the necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys, webhook secret) are set in production.\r\n- Include retry logic in case of intermittent service failures during webhook registration.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Database Changes:\r\n- **None**: This plugin does not introduce database dependencies.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Deployment Instructions:\r\n1. Set up the Coinbase API key file in a secure environment.\r\n2. Configure `runtime.character.settings.secrets` with the webhook secret.\r\n3. Verify the webhook functionality using test and production environments.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# [Discord](https://discord.gg/ai16z) Username:\r\n\r\n0x8664",

This was implemented originally by @oberlinstands and probably had a different dev workflow bc the eliza was not built and only the packages were installed. This is why the `/dev/null` may have been required bc the dev needed to build eliza then `pnpm start` inside the container.\r\n\r\nIn the package.json file we can see `pnpm docker` will execute this script for all 3 docker commands `build`, `run` and `bash`.  \r\n```\r\n\"docker:build\": \"bash ./scripts/docker.sh build\",\r\n\"docker:run\": \"bash ./scripts/docker.sh run\",\r\n\"docker:bash\": \"bash ./scripts/docker.sh bash\",\r\n\"docker:start\": \"bash ./scripts/docker.sh start\",\r\n\"docker\": \"pnpm docker:build && pnpm docker:run && pnpm docker:bash\",\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/ai16z/eliza/blob/438c1f1400e365510cae9c19dfc35ca4f663512d/package.json#L20C10-L20C78\r\n\r\nIf checking the `docker run` script, we can see that the command is executed based on this logic\r\n```\r\n # Start building the docker run command\r\nCMD=\"docker run --platform linux/amd64 -p 3000:3000 -d\"\r\n\r\n# Add base mounts\r\nfor mount in \"${BASE_MOUNTS[@]}\"; do\r\n   CMD=\"$CMD -v \\\"$(pwd)/$mount\\\"\"\r\ndone\r\n\r\n# Add package mounts\r\nfor package in \"${PACKAGES[@]}\"; do\r\n   CMD=\"$CMD -v \\\"$(pwd)/packages/$package/src:/app/packages/$package/src\\\"\"\r\ndone\r\n\r\n# Add core types mount separately (special case)\r\nCMD=\"$CMD -v \\\"$(pwd)/packages/core/types:/app/packages/core/types\\\"\"\r\n\r\n# Add container name and image\r\nCMD=\"$CMD --name eliza eliza\"\r\n\r\n# Execute the command\r\neval $CMD\r\n;;\r\n ```\r\n \r\nFor the last command `docker bash`, then we see that this. may be the culprit since it will try run \r\n```\r\n# Check if the container is running before executing bash\r\nif [ \"$(docker ps -q -f name=eliza)\" ]; then\r\n   docker exec -it eliza bash\r\nelse\r\n   echo \"Container 'eliza' is not running. Please start it first.\"\r\n   exit 1\r\nfi\r\n;;\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I run a test on `pnpm docker`, I will see this result:\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3596cc8b-12ae-452c-bb7c-1fdf648c8ccc)\r\n\r\nI think the change we are looking for is to remove bash command from the `pnpm docker` package script & let the docker image be built and run. If there are errors whenever this happens, then execute pnpm docker:bash to debug the docker image & find out what the problems are."

            "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nRight now actions are mostly seen as \"side effect\"  happening next to an answer sent by the agent.\r\nThere is no automated way to get the agent to call an action, interpret the result, and answer with that interpretation (which is what I would expect coming from OpenAI actions that are APIs that their runtime call and then get the result interpreted by the agent)\r\n\r\nRight now if I ask my agent: `what actions can you perform right now in the game?`\r\n1 - Agent response: `{ \"user\": \"Miaoulechat\", \"text\": \"I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?\", \"action\": \"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\" }`\r\n2 -Runtime processAction(\"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\"): `{ text: \"I can play dice, roulette, blackjack\" }`\r\n3 - Shown to user:\r\n```\r\n [\"\u25ce Agent: I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?\"] \r\n [\"\u25ce Agent: I can play dice, roulette, blackjack\"] \r\n```\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nThere are two things that could be done. \r\nThe simple one would just have the action result override the answer from the agent (so in the previous example, the first text `I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?` wouldn't even be sent to the client).\r\n\r\nThe complicated one, would have do a second back-and forth with the agent, after getting the action result, in order to interpret that result.\r\n\r\nA) simple:\r\n\r\n1 - Agent response: `{ \"user\": \"Miaoulechat\", \"text\": \"I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?\", \"action\": \"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\" }`\r\n2 -Runtime processAction(\"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\"): `{ text: \"I can play dice, roulette, blackjack\", type: \"OVERRIDE_ANSWER\" }`\r\n3 - Shown to user:\r\n```\r\n [\"\u25ce Agent: I can play dice, roulette, blackjack\"] \r\n```\r\n\r\n> here, simply adding a \"type\" (or any other field name) with value `OVERRIDE_ANSWER` to the action result, would tell the system to not send the agent answer, only the action result, to the client\r\n\r\nB) complicated:\r\n\r\n1 - Agent response: `{ \"user\": \"Miaoulechat\", \"text\": \"I can play, nap, or explore! What do you want to see?\", \"action\": \"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\" }`\r\n2 -Runtime processAction(\"LIST_GAME_ACTIONS\"): `{ data: ['dice', 'roulette', 'blackjack'], type: \"ACTION_RESULT_INTERPRETATION\" }`\r\n3 - Agent request: `{ prompt: \"You were just asked 'what actions can you perform right now in the game?' which triggered the action 'LIST_GAME_ACTIONS' and the result was ['dice', 'roulette', 'blackjack']. Can you compose an answer knowing the question and the result?\" }`\r\n4- Agent response: `{ \"user\": \"Miaoulechat\", \"text\": \"I can play dice, roulette and blackjack\"}`\r\n5 - Shown to user:\r\n```\r\n [\"\u25ce Agent: I can play dice, roulette and blackjack\"] \r\n```\r\n\r\n> here, there is a second message sent to the agent, telling it \"this is what happened, this is the result, can you interpret it?\". This would be done again through some \"type\"  (`ACTION_RESULT_INTERPRETATION`) on the action result, which would be some kind of \"operation\" to be done by the runtime.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nRight now as an alternative, I go with the \"simple\" solution, and at the client level, if there is any message with a `type: \"OVERRIDE_ANSWER\"` I remove all other messages from the returned messages.\r\n\r\nBut this forces me to do a fork of all the clients to add that filter, when it could be done earlier in the runtime / pipeline.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nI'm comparing \"actions\" to OpenAI actions where the agent detects that an action is possible from the prompt and a list of actions that are submitted (it also detects parameters)\r\nThen the agent call the API with those parameters\r\nThe API answers, and the agent interpret the result, create a constructed answer, and returns that answer.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to have a similar behavior for actions here\r\n",

            "body": "**Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.**\r\n\r\nMany image generation services such as FAL, Stable Diffusion, etc. have \"safety checkers\" that ensure prompts are appropriate.\r\nThese have several problems:\r\n\r\n1. Additional latency: These checks are done via an LLM, which can add unnecessary latency.\r\n2. Unpredictable / incorrect outputs: Since the checks use LLMs, their output can be overly restrictive or random, causing unpredictable behavior.\r\n3. Not necessary: Some use cases don't require the safety checker.\r\n\r\nIn particular, we at [daojones.ai](daojones.ai) ([@DAOJonesPumpAI](x.com/DAOJonesPumpAI) on X.com) have found this is overly restrictive and have written a custom image generation application that disables it.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nWe want to set the FAL configuration for our image requests.\r\nWe need to set `enable_safety_checker` to `false` while also setting `safety_tolerance` to `6` (the most tolerant setting).\r\nSince these options are not uniformly supported by the different APIs, we will just add an \"escape hatch\" configuration `imageSettings.fal`.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\n1. Turning safety checker off globally: This would work for our use case but could be a breaking change for other use cases.\r\n2. Adding a global `allowNsfw` flag: This requires reconciling this with other APIs and determining what settings it would correspond to.\r\n3. Adding the `enableSafetyChecker` / `safetyTolerance` flags at the top level of `imageSettings`: this would pollute the global namespace.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\n<!-- Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here. -->\r\n",

Review the `getCloudflareGatewayBaseURL` function in `generation.ts`\r\n2. Check gateway integration in provider handlers\r\n3. Verify documentation clarity in `configuration.md`\r\n\r\n### Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Configure Cloudflare AI Gateway:\r\n   ```bash\r\n   CLOUDFLARE_GW_ENABLED=true\r\n   CLOUDFLARE_AI_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account-id\r\n   CLOUDFLARE_AI_GATEWAY_ID=your-gateway-id\r\n   ```\r\n\r\n2. Test with different providers:\r\n   - Verify OpenAI requests route through gateway\r\n   - Verify Anthropic requests route through gateway\r\n   - Verify Groq requests route through gateway\r\n\r\n3. Test fallback behavior:\r\n   - Disable gateway and verify direct API calls\r\n   - Use invalid configuration and verify fallback\r\n   - Check logging messages for debugging info\r\n\r\n### Expected Results\r\n- When gateway is properly configured:\r\n  - Requests route through Cloudflare\r\n  - Logs show gateway URL being used\r\n  - Response handling remains unchanged\r\n\r\n- When gateway is disabled/misconfigured:\r\n  - Fallback to direct API calls\r\n  - Warning logs indicate configuration issues\r\n  - Service continues to function normally\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nw3_bounty",
