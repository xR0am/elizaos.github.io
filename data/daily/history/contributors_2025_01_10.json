                "body": "Analysis:\r\n\r\n1. Character set expansion:\r\n- The original regex only allowed alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and whitespace.\r\n- The new regex significantly expands the allowed character set:\r\n  - \\p{L}: Any kind of letter from any language\r\n  - \\p{N}: Any kind of numeric character in any script\r\n  - \\s: Whitespace (same as before)\r\n  - -_./:?=&: Allows hyphens, underscores, periods, forward slashes, colons, question marks, equal signs, and ampersands\r\n\r\n2. Potential security implications:\r\n- The expanded character set could potentially allow for more types of injections or attacks, particularly:\r\n  - Path traversal attacks (due to allowing '/' and '.')\r\n  - URL manipulation (due to allowing '/', ':', '?', '=', and '&')\r\n  - Potential for cross-site scripting (XSS) if the content is rendered in HTML, especially due to allowing '&' which could be used in HTML entities\r\n\r\n3. Unicode support:\r\n- The addition of the 'u' flag enables full Unicode support, which could potentially allow for Unicode-based evasion techniques.\r\n\r\n4. Global flag:\r\n- Both versions use the global flag 'g', which is appropriate for replacing all occurrences.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Conclusion**: While the new regex allows for more natural language input (including non-Latin scripts) and common URL components, it also introduces potential security risks. The change could enable malicious activities such as path traversal, URL manipulation, and potentially XSS if proper output encoding is not implemented.\r\n\r\nTo mitigate risks:\r\n1. Ensure strong input validation and sanitization beyond this regex.\r\n2. Implement proper output encoding when rendering the content.\r\n3. Consider the context where this messageContent is used and adjust the allowed characters accordingly.\r\n4. If URL components are not needed, consider removing '/', ':', '?', '=', and '&' from the allowed set.\r\n\r\nIt's crucial to thoroughly test this change and implement additional security measures appropriate for the specific use case of this messageContent."

            "body": "When a user wants to verify a log's signature using a public key, they first need to ensure that the public key was indeed generated within the TEE. This requires the user to verify the correctness of the remote attestation. However, users obtain the remote attestation by accessing the `/verifiable/attestation` endpoint, which calls the `generateAttestation` function. This function doesn't validate the agent ID and public key from the user's request, but instead directly generates a remote attestation. This doesn't prove that the public key corresponds to a private key generated within the TEE.\r\nAssuming TLS communication is established between the user and Eliza, I propose two correct approaches:\r\n\r\nThe user provides the agent_id, subject, and publicKey required for private key generation to the `generateAttestation` function. Within this function, a key pair is generated using deriveKey, and the resulting public key is compared with the publicKey parameter. If they match, an attestation report should be generated with the publicKey included in the report.\r\nSince Eliza has already stored the publicKey in the SQLite database during initial registerAgent, if we can ensure that the SQLite database content is encrypted and cannot be tampered with by software outside the TEE, the `generateAttestation` function can directly read the publicKey from the database using the agent_id, subject, and keypath. It then compares this with the publicKey in the user's request, and if they match, generates an attestation report.\r\n\r\nIn the current implementation, if someone sends a log to a user with a signature generated by a private key from outside the TEE, and provides this forged public key to the user, when the user requests an attestation through the `/verifiable/attestation` endpoint with the agent_id and corresponding public key, Eliza running in the TEE will directly send a valid attestation to the user. This allows users to be deceived\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @lightning-li in https://github.com/elizaOS/eliza/pull/1369#discussion_r1908145251_\r\n            ",

If there is a related issue, it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nWe're making these changes to address two issues:\r\n1. Bug Fix: There was a bug in the `/agents/:agentId/:roomId/memories` endpoint at `client-direct` where `stringToUuid()` was being incorrectly applied to the roomId parameter. This caused:\r\n- The original valid UUID to be unnecessarily converted\r\n- Generation of a new, different UUID\r\n- Failed memory retrievals due to UUID mismatch\r\n\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5cbe780-59ab-4e19-9f68-f9cee9f4fa33)\r\nTo further show case the problem, orginal room ID: `ad22e47a-3fd0-05dc-8791-8fba9e475378` was altered by `stringToUuid()` to `8e9b5550-ca28-0f3c-a1f4-f13c2cdf3dca`, leading to memories failed to be fetched by `runtime.messageManager.getMemories`.\r\n\r\nResponse:\r\n```\r\n{\r\n  \"agentId\": \"b850bc30-45f8-0041-a00a-83df46d8555d\",\r\n  \"roomId\": \"8e9b5550-ca28-0f3c-a1f4-f13c2cdf3dca\",\r\n  \"memories\": []\r\n}\r\n```\r\n2. Defensive Programming: The API server was not validating UUID parameters, which led to:\r\n- No validation of input format\r\n- Silent failures when invalid UUIDs were provided\r\n\r\nThis PR implements proper input validation and error handling, making the API more robust and developer-friendly.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf documentation change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR.

Review the UUID type validation function introduced at packages/core/src/uuid.ts\r\n2. Review the new validateUUIDParams function in packages/client-direct/src/api.ts\r\n3. Check the implementation across all API endpoints that use agentId or roomId\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Test `/agents/:agentId/:roomId/memories` endpoint:\r\n\r\n- With valid UUIDs - should work normally\r\n- With invalid agentId - should return 400 with appropriate error message\r\n- With invalid roomId - should return 400 with appropriate error message\r\n\r\n2. Test other endpoints with agentId parameter:\r\n\r\n- `/agents/:agentId`\r\n- `/agents/:agentId/set`\r\n- `/agents/:agentId/channels`\r\n\r\n3. Verify error messages from 1. are clear and helpful.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone: Automated tests are acceptable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

If the TEE node running the specified AI agent shuts down for any reason, another TEE node can download the AI agent's \"life\" data from the chain and resume its operation. This data is encrypted by the TEE, ensuring that only the same version of TEE Eliza can download and restore the agent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n* Improvements\r\n  * Modify the core package to enable on-chain da upload/download\r\n* Features (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n  * Add blockchain adopter to store on-chain information\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there are no linked issues explaining why.

Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nWe introduced this feature in this post:\r\n\r\nhttps://x.com/CP2426_/status/1873551311205228838  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf documentation change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR. This will really help if the PR needs to be retested and probably help the PR get merged quicker. -->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nLearn our design:\r\n\r\n1. Defining Eliza\u2019s Ghost\r\n\r\n    Eliza is a highly abstract framework. The core data structure related to its Ghost is its memory, which includes:\r\n\r\n    Agent metadata defined in the character.\r\n    Message data generated through interaction with the outside world.\r\n\r\n    Together, these form its \u201cpersonality\u201d and \u201cmemory.\u201d As Eliza expands, it may also hold a wallet, and the underlying key is one of the key pieces of its Ghost data.\r\n\r\n2. Serialization and Encryption of Ghost\r\n\r\n    Once the Ghost is defined, it needs to be extracted from Eliza\u2019s specific implementation and uploaded externally. Thus, a suitable serialization way is required.\r\n\r\n    We define a Blob Chain data structure:\r\n    * Each Blob\u2019s payload can store multiple memory entries.\r\n    * The Blob is encrypted using TEE Eliza\u2019s key, inaccessible to other versions.\r\n    * Blobs are sequentially linked in a chain. (Future expansions could use a DAG structure? Gosh fork? Who knows! \ud83d\ude02)\r\n\r\n    By simply storing the latest Blob, all memories can be retrieved.\r\n\r\n3. Uploading and Downloading Ghost\r\n\r\n    When Eliza is launched as a new AI agent:\r\n    It registers on-chain with a decentralized identity registration smart contract. Each Eliza has a unique name serving as a key to store the address of the Last Blob.\r\n\r\n    During Eliza's runtime:\r\n    The Memory Manager continuously generates memories and periodically packages and uploads them.\r\n\r\n    For recovery:\r\n    With just the name, Eliza\u2019s TEE plugin can restore the same key, locate the Last Blob in the smart contract, and download the memory for self-recovery.\r\n    Not all memories need to be downloaded\u2014only the most recent ones suffice.\r\n\r\n4. Extension\r\n\r\n    We\u2019ve designed an extensible DA (Data Availability) adaptor that can cater to the agent\u2019s needs:\r\n\r\n    DA can be expensive, so memories can be uploaded to different platforms based on user preference:\r\n    * calldata of blockchain transaction\r\n    * celestia DA.\r\n    * other reliable storage solutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone: Automated tests are acceptable.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n  - [do action]\r\n  - verify [result]\r\n  -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

It is extra nice to annotate screenshots with arrows or boxes pointing out the differences. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Screenshots\r\n### Before\r\n### After\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is anything about the deployment, please make a note. -->\r\n<!--\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--  Copy and paste command line output. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Database changes\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--  Please specify deploy instructions if there is something more than the automated steps. -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/ai16z and state your Discord username here for the contributor role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\n-->",

It successfully queried the app and showed the relevant response.\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Add the new `@elizaos/plugin-asterai` plugin to an Eliza character\r\n2. Setup the ENV vars according to your asterai application. Instructions are in the new package's README.\r\n3. Ask the Eliza character a question that the asterai app can answer. For example, add the StockInfo plugin to the asterai app and test that Eliza can answer questions about stock prices by agent proxy.\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\nThe package should be published on a repository like NPM so that users can consume the plugin easily.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nrellfy\r\n",
