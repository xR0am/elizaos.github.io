Added multichain support, the current version of the plugin only supported mainnet and Base, and there have been several requests for additional EVM chain support.\r\n\r\n- The plugin lacked test coverage, so we initiated tests alongside the feature development, starting with WalletProvider.\r\n- Refactored the plugin to make it more test-friendly and modular.\r\n- Added multichain support (for viem chains)\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\n- Improvements: Refactoring, cleaning, and testing of the existing plugin.\r\n- Fixes: fix transfer action\r\n- Features: Non-breaking changes to add EVM multichain support. The previous character configuration even though accepted evm chain config array, but in fact it was not implemented \r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nInitially, the goal was to add IoTeX EVM chain support. However, the scope was expanded to include general multichain support, given the demand for broader compatibility.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\nCurrently, the project documentation does not cover blockchain configurations, including EVM plugin setup. No changes are required at this time.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## How was it tested\r\n\r\n- Ran test scripts \r\n- Verified functionality through agent interactions:\r\n<img width=\"709\" alt=\"Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 5 58 35\u202fPM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/afde079e-7eaa-47cd-89df-60a93f895cd3\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\nFile: packages/plugin-evm/src/tests/wallet.test.ts\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nTry to add your own chain in the character and ask the agent to send some tokens.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nnikita_zhou",

While there are translations for several other languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean, French, etc.), Hebrew-speaking users cannot read the documentation in their native language. This is particularly important because Hebrew requires special RTL (Right-to-Left) formatting considerations.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\n\r\nAdd a complete Hebrew (RTL) translation of the main README.md as README_HE.md, including:  \r\n\r\n - Full translation of all sections including features, installation instructions, and usage guidelines  \r\n - Proper RTL formatting using HTML/CSS directives\r\n - Addition of Hebrew (\u05e2\u05b4\u05d1\u05e8\u05b4\u05d9\u05ea) to the language selector at the top of all README files\r\nMaintenance of all existing functionality (links, images, code blocks)\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\n\r\nUsing browser-based translation tools (like Chrome's translate feature) - inadequate because it doesn't handle RTL formatting properly and translations are often inaccurate\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\n\r\nHebrew is spoken by approximately 9 million people globally\r\n\r\nThe translation should follow the same pattern as other language translations in the repo (README_XX.md format)\r\n\r\nSpecial attention should be paid to RTL formatting using <div align=\"rtl\"> tags to ensure proper text direction\r\n\r\nThis addition will make the project more accessible to the Hebrew-speaking developer community",

Built to support twitter for now.\r\n\r\nLeverages Privy as the account repository and Privy import feature to add users social account. This creates a wallet on behalf of the user that they can claim by logging in with twitter on that Privy instance.\r\n\r\nIn the future, the data source could be replaced with an onchain social registry that anyone can opt into themselves to link their socials to a wallet, using TEE-verified oauth. With a reserve vault smart contract layer on top of that, this could hold tokens sent to users that haven't signed up yet and then easily be claimed on signup.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nTo enable agents to send tokens directly to twitter handles without having to know the users wallet address. This could spark entirely new forms of meta games, stories, and economies.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/61408862-0a18-4e8e-a656-914dc83f8ee0)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9ff281c-a152-4f57-8af7-77296e764009)\r\n![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4d9b75c4-f29c-4c7f-8f70-70e44770afb4)\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n`/packages/plugin-social-wallets`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nAdd env values for:\r\n- PRIVY_APP_ID\r\n- PRIVY_APP_SECRET\r\n- EVM_PRIVATE_KEY\r\n- TWITTER_USERNAME\r\n- TWITTER_PASSWORD\r\n- TWITTER_EMAIL\r\n\r\nRun `sh ./scripts/start.sh`\r\nAsk agent `send 0.001 ETH to @<twitter_username>`\r\n\r\nIn addition some adjustments may need to be made to plugin-evm that triggers the TX flow. Last time we tested, that plugin was giving us some issues and we had to resolve them to get the plugin to trigger.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n@djdabs_\r\n",
