[CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):\n\n> \u203c\ufe0f **IMPORTANT**\n> Auto-reply has been disabled for this repository in the CodeRabbit settings. The CodeRabbit bot will not respond to your replies unless it is explicitly tagged.\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Changes are additive and follow existing patterns.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR adds support for a new embedding provider called \"Heurist\" with the following changes:\r\n1. Adds HEURIST_EMBEDDING_MODEL configuration with BAAI/bge-large-en-v1.5 as default\r\n2. Integrates Heurist into the embedding provider system with 1024 dimension vectors\r\n3. Updates model configurations to use meta-llama/llama-3.3-70b-instruct and FLUX.1-dev\r\n4. Implements remote embedding functionality for the Heurist provider\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality) - Adds new embedding provider capability\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation to document the new Heurist embedding provider and its configuration options.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Check the .env.example file for the new HEURIST_EMBEDDING_MODEL configuration\r\n2. Review the embedding.ts changes for proper integration\r\n3. Verify the model configuration updates in the Models section\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Configure HEURIST_EMBEDDING_MODEL in environment\r\n2.

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

There's no validation that the imported plugins conform to the expected plugin interface.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, consider adding plugin validation:\n```diff\n async function handlePluginImporting(plugins: string[]) {\n+    interface ElizaPlugin {\n+        // Add minimum required plugin interface\n+        name?: string;\n+        initialize?: () => Promise<void>;\n+    }\n+\n+    function isValidPlugin(plugin: any): plugin is ElizaPlugin {\n+        return typeof plugin === 'function' || \n+               (typeof plugin === 'object' && plugin !== null);\n+    }\n+\n     if (plugins.length > 0) {\n         elizaLogger.info(\"Plugins are: \", plugins);\n         const importedPlugins = await Promise.all(\n             plugins.map(async (plugin) => {\n                 try {\n                     const importedPlugin = await import(plugin);\n                     const functionName =\n                         plugin\n                             .replace(\"@elizaos/plugin-\", \"\")\n                             .replace(/-./g, (x) => x[1].toUpperCase()) +\n                         \"Plugin\";\n-                    return (\n-                        importedPlugin.default || importedPlugin[functionName]\n-                    );\n+                    const pluginFunction = importedPlugin.default || importedPlugin[functionName];\n+                    if (!isValidPlugin(pluginFunction)) {\n+                        throw new Error(`Invalid plugin format: ${plugin}`);\n+                    }\n+                    return pluginFunction;\n                 } catch (importError) {\n                     elizaLogger.error(\n                         `Failed to import plugin: ${plugin}`,\n                         importError\n                     );\n-                    return []; // Return null for failed imports\n+                    throw importError; // Propagate error to caller\n                 }\n             })\n-        );\n+        ).catch(error => {\n+            elizaLogger.error('Plugin loading failed:', error);\n+            return []; // Return empty array only at top level\n+        });\n         return importedPlugins;\n     } else {\n         return [];\n     }\n }\n```\n\n</blockquote></details>\n\n</blockquote></details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83d\udcdc Review details</summary>\n\n**Configuration used: CodeRabbit UI**\n**Review profile: CHILL**\n**Plan: Pro**\n\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83d\udce5 Commits</summary>\n\nReviewing files that changed from the base of the PR and between 2314e215f404aad3b2ae7f5d7f8172ff76194987 and 1813bf1962af6d1014c23df4032cf9cdc9db8992.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83d\udcd2 Files selected for processing (2)</summary>\n\n* `agent/package.json` (1 hunks)\n* `agent/src/index.ts` (3 hunks)\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83d\udea7 Files skipped from review as they are similar to previous changes (1)</summary>\n\n* agent/package.json\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\u23f0 Context from checks skipped due to timeout of 90000ms (1)</summary>\n\n* GitHub Check: integration-tests\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83d\udd07 Additional comments (1)</summary><blockquote>\n\n<details>\n<summary>agent/src/index.ts (1)</summary>\n\n`799-802`: _:hammer_and_wrench: Refactor suggestion_\n\n**Add error handling for plugin importing in startAgent.**\n\nSimilar to the `loadCharacters` function, plugin importing should be wrapped in a try-catch block.\n\n```diff\n     directClient.startAgent = async (character) => {\n-        // Handle plugins\n-        character.plugins = await handlePluginImporting(character.plugins);\n+        try {\n+            character.plugins = await handlePluginImporting(character.plugins);\n+        } catch (error) {\n+            elizaLogger.error(`Failed to load plugins for character ${character.name}:`, error);\n+            // Consider whether to throw or continue with empty plugins array\n+            character.plugins = [];\n+        }\n\n         // wrap it so we don't have to inject directClient later\n         return startAgent(character, directClient);\n     };\n```\n\n\n\n\n> Likely invalid or redundant comment.\n\n</details>\n\n</blockquote></details>\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment by CodeRabbit for review status -->"

Simultaneously, the `agent/src/index.ts` file undergoes a refactoring of plugin handling, with a new `handlePluginImporting` function replacing the previous `isAllStrings` function. The changes improve plugin import error management and streamline the plugin loading process for the agent.\n\n## Changes\n\n| File | Change Summary |\n|------|----------------|\n| `agent/package.json` | Added two new dependencies: <br>- `@elizaos/plugin-video-generation` <br>- `@elizaos/plugin-web-search` |\n| `agent/src/index.ts` | - Removed `isAllStrings` function <br>- Added `handlePluginImporting` async function <br>- Updated plugin import logic in `loadCharacters` and `startAgent` methods |\n\n## Sequence Diagram\n\n```mermaid\nsequenceDiagram\n    participant Agent\n    participant PluginImporter\n    participant Plugins\n\n    Agent->>PluginImporter: Call handlePluginImporting\n    PluginImporter->>Plugins: Attempt to import plugins\n    alt Import Successful\n        Plugins-->>PluginImporter: Return imported plugins\n    else Import Failed\n        PluginImporter-->>Agent: Return empty array\n        PluginImporter->>Agent: Log import errors\n    end\n```\n\n## Poem\n\n> \ud83d\udc30 Plugins dancing, new and bright,  \n> Importing magic with all my might!  \n> Web search, video - what a treat,  \n> Errors caught, my code's now neat! \ud83c\udfac\ud83d\udd0d  \n> Rabbit's code, forever light! \ud83c\udf1f\n\n<!-- walkthrough_end -->\n<!-- internal state start -->\n\n\n<!-- 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 -->\n\n<!-- internal state end -->\n<!-- tips_start -->\n\n---\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>\ud83e\udea7 Tips</summary>\n\n### Chat\n\nThere are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):\n\n- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

The changes include adding configuration options in `.env.example`, integrating a new `@elizaos/plugin-autonome` package, and implementing a launch agent functionality. The plugin enables conditional loading of Autonome-specific features based on JWT token configuration, expanding the agent's capabilities with a new RPC-based launch mechanism.\n\n## Changes\n\n| File | Change Summary |\n|------|----------------|\n| `.env.example` | Added two new configuration entries: `AUTONOME_JWT_TOKEN` and `AUTONOME_RPC` |\n| `agent/package.json` | Added `@elizaos/plugin-autonome` as a workspace dependency |\n| `agent/src/index.ts` | Imported `autonomePlugin` and conditionally added to agent plugins |\n| `packages/plugin-autonome/*` | Created new

The CodeRabbit bot will not respond to your replies unless it is explicitly tagged.\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Set up the Eliza platform with the Lens Testnet plugin.\r\n2. As a user, navigate to the transfer section and select Lens Testnet as the network.\r\n3. Say Eliza to make a transfer of Grass tokens to another user.\r\n4. Verify that the transaction completes successfully on the Lens Testnet.  \r\n5. Check for any logs or errors during the transfer.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\nNo special deployment instructions are needed beyond the standard deployment steps for plugins.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Database changes\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n\r\nFollow standard deployment instructions for adding a plugin to the Eliza platform.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\npallovp\r\n",

The CodeRabbit bot will not respond to your replies unless it is explicitly tagged.\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Introduces a new `farcasterConfig` configuration system\r\n2. Adds new environment variable `ENABLE_POST` for better control over posting functionality\r\n3. Refactors the Farcaster client interface for improved maintainability\r\n4. Updates post and interactions management using the new configuration system\r\n5. Improves code organization in the Farcaster client module\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\n- Code refactoring to improve maintainability and configuration management\r\n- Better environment variable handling\r\n- Enhanced code organization\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation to reflect:\r\n- New environment variable `ENABLE_POST`\r\n- Updated Farcaster client configuration system\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review the new environment configuration in `packages/client-farcaster/src/environment.ts`\r\n2. Check the refactored client interface in `packages/client-farcaster/src/client.ts`\r\n3. Review the updated post and interactions implementation\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Verify environment variable setup:\r\n   - Copy new variables from `.env.example` to `.env`\r\n   - Verify `ENABLE_POST` functionality\r\n2. Test Farcaster client operations:\r\n   - Verify post functionality works with new configuration\r\n   - Check interactions with refactored client interface\r\n3. Ensure backward compatibility:\r\n   - Verify existing integrations continue to work\r\n   - Check for any potential breaking changes in the client interface\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n- Update environment variables according to `.env.example`\r\n- No database changes required",

Through the `@property` decorator, the generation of ContentClass and its Template becomes more automated without the need for additional manual creation.\r\n\r\nIf you want to use this di plugin, your plugin exports will look like:\r\n\r\n```\r\nimport { CreateResourceAction } from \"./sampleAction\";\r\nimport { SampleProvider } from \"./sampleProvider\";\r\nimport { SampleEvaluator } from \"./sampleEvalutor\";\r\nimport { PluginOptions } from \"../types\";\r\n\r\nexport const samplePlugin: PluginOptions = {\r\n    name: \"sample\",\r\n    description: \"Enables creation and management of generic resources\",\r\n    actions: [CreateResourceAction],\r\n    providers: [SampleProvider],\r\n    evaluators: [SampleEvaluator],\r\n    // separate examples will be added for services and clients\r\n    services: [],\r\n    clients: [],\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default samplePlugin;\r\n```\r\n\r\n**All the actions, providers, evaluators are `Class` instead of `Object`.**\r\n\r\nSo the normalization process is added to `agent/src/index.ts`'s `startAgents` method:\r\n\r\n```typescript\r\nimport { normalizeCharacter } from \"@elizaos/plugin-di\";\r\n\r\nconst startAgents = async () => {\r\n    // ... \r\n\r\n    if (charactersArg) {\r\n        characters = await loadCharacters(charactersArg);\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    // Normalize characters for injectable plugins\r\n    characters = await Promise.all(characters.map(normalizeCharacter));\r\n\r\n    // ....\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis `normalizeCharacter` method will normalize the plugin with dependency injection Class to the normal plugin.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\n1. The `Action` and `Provider` in some plugins hope to be initialized in a dynamic way rather than directly exporting an object.\r\n2. Some `Provider`s may be shared among multiple `Plugin`s. They need to exist in a `Singleton` instance rather than creating an instance for each plugin.\r\n3. There are many elements in `Action` that can be automated through decorator definitions, and this plugin provides a convenient abstract class.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n`pnpm test --filter=@elizaos/plugin-di`\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\nrun test cases\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\nbt.wood",

This comprehensive addition provides a robust framework for creating modular and extensible plugins using dependency injection techniques. The package includes base classes, decorators, factories, and example implementations that demonstrate how to build injectable actions, providers, and evaluators.\n\n## Changes\n\n| File | Change Summary |\n|------|----------------|\n| `agent/package.json` | Added `@elizaos/plugin-di` as a workspace dependency |\n| `agent/src/index.ts` | Imported `normalizeCharacter` to process character plugins during agent startup |\n| `packages/plugin-di/...` | New package with comprehensive DI implementation, including:<br>- Base classes for actions and evaluators<br>- Content decorators<br>-

[CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):\n\n> \u203c\ufe0f **IMPORTANT**\n> Auto-reply has been disabled for this repository in the CodeRabbit settings. The CodeRabbit bot will not respond to your replies unless it is explicitly tagged.\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Adds `plugin-solana-v2`, leveraging the latest features of `@solana/web3.js` v2\r\n  - This plugin can be used alongside existing plugins that use `@solana/web3.js` v1.\r\n  - Other protocols can use this plugin to integrate their functionality, if their tooling leverages `@solana/web3.js` v2\r\n  - The `pluting-tee` uses `Keypair` from `@solana/web3.js` v1, while v2 uses `CryptoKeyPair` from the web api. To account for this, I added some utils that add TEE functionality for solana-plugin-v2 as well (tested locally).\r\n2. Adds autonomous LP repositioning capabilities on Orca\r\n  - Automatically repositions liquidity positions if the center price of the position deviates from the current pool price by more than a user-specified threshold (`repositionThresholdBps`).\r\n  - Maintains the original width of the position during repositioning.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nFuture proof Eliza for new projects that build on top of the new Solana SDK.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nI added a README to the plugin.\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\nI'm currently still testing the stability of the repositioning functionality. The behavior of the agent is at times unpredictable. I would like one of the core devs to give me guidance on the following:\r\n- explain in detail the inner workings of provider-evaluator loop,\r\n- explain what information each of the components needs,\r\n- how all three components interact with state and memory\r\n- how to control the timing of the loop to control the amount of API/RPC calls,\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\nTBA\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\nTBA\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\n@calintje\r\n",

List what kind of risks and what could be affected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nVerifiable agent is emerging and zkTLS is a promising way to enhance transparency and trust for AI Agents. The current solutions focus on the verifiability of LLM inference, but it is not all the behaviour of an agent. In the Eliza framework. LLM is the brain of agent, but it also have actions and external source providers. We aim to make all these activities verifiable.\r\n\r\nRecap of zkTLS: zkTLS is a cryptographic protocol that allows third parties to verify the authenticity of TLS transcripts in a privacy-preserving way.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\nThis PR introduces the Primus adapter and plugin, enabling verifiability for LLM inference, actions, and interactions with external providers. Different zkTLS modes are provided, including MPC-TLS and Proxy-TLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there are no linked issues explaining why. If there is a related issue, it might make sense to skip this why section. -->\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nIn the Eliza framework, an agent consists of three key components: a brain (accessing an LLM), actions (the tasks the\r\nagent performs), and perception (gathering external information from providers). To fully verify agent activities, it's\r\nessential to ensure that the agent's thoughts, actions, and external information requests are all verifiable. \r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nThe documentation in `packages/plugin-primus/README.md` has been updated, with no further changes needed.\r\n<!--\r\nMy changes do not require a change to the project documentation.\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nIf documentation change is needed: I have updated the documentation accordingly.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Please show how you tested the PR.

            "body": "# CKB Fiber Plugin\r\n[Fiber](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/fiber) is a type of Lightning Network that enables AI Agents to make stablecoin payments using the Lightning Network. This PR introduces a new plugin: the CKB Fiber Plugin, enabling the Eliza agent to interact with the Fiber Network by managing a Fiber node. We implemented a standalone Fiber Network RPC client and developed a series of actions within the Eliza framework. These actions leverage the RPC client to send RPC requests and facilitate communication with the Fiber node.\r\n\r\n# Configuration\r\nThe plugin requires the following environment variables:\r\n``` env\r\n# CKB Fiber Configuration\r\nFIBER_ENABLE=true\r\n\r\nFIBER_RPC_URL=  # RPC url of your Fiber node, anyone can control the Fiber node through this RPC, so make sure that the RPC url cannot be accessed externally. Default is http://127.0.0.1:8227\r\nFIBER_RPC_HEADERS=  # (Optional) The headers of the Fiber RPC (JSON string). It is used to authenticate the Fiber RPC if needed\r\n\r\nFIBER_DEFAULT_PEER_ID=QmSqSsbjkQG6aMBNEkG6hMLKQpMjLW3eaBmUdCghpRWqwJ  # The default peer id of the Fiber node, it is used to connect to the Fiber network, you can get it from https://testnet.explorer.nervos.org/fiber/graph/nodes\r\nFIBER_DEFAULT_PEER_ADDRESS=/ip4/43.198.162.23/tcp/8228/p2p/QmSqSsbjkQG6aMBNEkG6hMLKQpMjLW3eaBmUdCghpRWqwJ  # The default peer address of the Fiber node, it is used to connect to the Fiber network, you can get it from https://testnet.explorer.nervos.org/fiber/graph/nodes\r\n\r\nFIBER_CKB_FUNDING_AMOUNT=  # (Optional) The default funding amount when open the default channel\r\nFIBER_UDT_FUNDING_AMOUNTS=  # (Optional) The default funding udt amounts (JSON string) when open the default channel\r\n```\r\nYou can check the default values in `src/constants.ts`\r\n\r\n# Available Actions\r\n\r\n1. **GET_INFO**: Retrieves the current node information from the agent-controlled Fiber node.\r\n\r\n2. **LIST_CHANNELS**: Lists all the opened channels of the agent-controlled Fiber node.\r\n\r\n3. **SEND_PAYMENT**: Given an invoice, payment amount, and asset type (CKB, USDI, or RUSD) in the context, the agent-controlled Fiber node will verify and send the payment.\r\n\r\n4. **GET_PAYMENT**: Given a specific payment hash, retrieves the payment details.\r\n\r\n5. **NEW_INVOICE**: Given an amount and asset type (CKB, USDI, or RUSD), the agent generates a new invoice, enabling others to send funds to the agent-controlled Fiber node.\r\n\r\n# Cautions & Notes\r\n- **Start Your Fiber Node:** Before using the CKB Fiber Plugin, ensure that your Fiber node is up and running. The Fiber node should be connected to the Fiber network and have sufficient channels opened to facilitate payment transactions. Check [nervosnetwork/fiber](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/fiber) for more information.\r\n\r\n- **Network Access Control:** If the Fiber node\u2019s RPC URL is exposed to the external network without proper access control, there could be potential unauthorized access. Ensure the RPC URL is secured or only accessible within the local network to avoid unintended exposure.\r\n\r\n- **Sensitive Actions:** Some actions, such as transfers, involve handling sensitive operations. These actions should be properly secured to prevent users from directly triggering them in inappropriate scenarios (e.g., unauthorized transfers). Ensuring proper access control and validation for these actions is critical.\r\n\r\n- **Channel and Network Connectivity:** If the Fiber node is not connected to the network or doesn't have enough channels opened, SEND_PAYMENT action will fail. This could affect the overall functionality and cause disruptions in the intended operations of the Fiber node and Eliza Agent interactions.\r\n\r\n# Benefits\r\n\r\n### Seamless CKB Integration\r\n\r\n- **Native CKB Support**: Effortlessly integrate CKB blockchain functionalities into your applications.\r\n- **Efficient Transaction Handling**: Streamlined processes for sending and receiving CKB transactions.\r\n\r\n### Robust Financial Operations\r\n\r\n- **Automated Payment Processing**: Facilitate automated payments for services such as API calls, content generation, and more.\r\n- **Multi-Layer Transaction Support**: Handle both on-chain and Layer 2 transactions for enhanced flexibility and scalability.\r\n- **Real-Time Balance Monitoring**: Keep track of wallet balances with up-to-date information and notifications.\r\n\r\n### Flexible Payment Options\r\n\r\n- **Multi-Currency Support**: Accept payments in various cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies with automatic conversion.\r\n- **Customizable Fee Structures**: Adjust transaction fees based on real-time market data and user preferences.\r\n- **Recurring Payments**: Set up recurring billing for subscription-based services, ensuring consistent revenue streams.\r\n\r\n### Enhanced Security\r\n\r\n- **Secure Key Management**: Protect private keys using environment variables and secure storage solutions.\r\n- **Advanced Encryption**: Ensure all sensitive data is encrypted both in transit and at rest to maintain user privacy.\r\n\r\n# Implementation Status\r\n\r\n### Core CKB Functionality\r\n\r\n- Full support for CKB blockchain operations, including transaction creation and validation.\r\n- Integration with CKB's native wallets and APIs for seamless user interactions.\r\n\r\n### Fiber Framework Integration\r\n\r\n- Seamless incorporation with the Fiber web framework, ensuring high performance and scalability.\r\n- Middleware support for efficient request handling and processing within Fiber applications.\r\n\r\n### Payment Processing Features\r\n\r\n- Automated payment workflows implemented, enabling smooth financial transactions between agents.\r\n- Support for both on-chain and Layer 2 transactions to cater to different scalability and cost requirements.\r\n\r\n### USD Denomination Support\r\n\r\n- Enable USD-denominated transactions with automatic cryptocurrency conversion based on real-time exchange rates.\r\n- Integration of real-time price feeds to ensure accurate fee estimation and financial reporting.\r\n\r\n### Upcoming Features\r\n\r\n- **Enhanced Analytics**: Development of advanced dashboards for monitoring transaction metrics and user activity (planned).\r\n- **Extended Protocol Support**: Ongoing work to integrate additional blockchain protocols, expanding the plugin's versatility and applicability.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- [x] **Payment Actions:** Implement actions to send and receive payments using the Fiber Network.\r\n- [ ] **Channel Management:** Implement actions to manage channels, including opening, closing, and updating channels.\r\n- [ ] **CKB functionality:** Implement actions to interact with CKB, such as querying balances, sending CKB transactions, and managing UDTs.\r\n- [ ] **Payment History:** Implement actions to retrieve payment history and details for the agent-controlled Fiber node.\r\n- [ ] **Authorization and Access Control:** Because some actions involve sensitive operations, implementing proper authorization and access control mechanisms is essential.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n``` bash\r\ncd packages/plugin-ckb-fiber\r\npnpm test\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Usage\r\n\r\n## Integration\r\n\r\n``` typescript\r\n\r\n// Assume this is the user's message received by the client\r\nconst message: Memory = {\r\n  id: stringToUuid(\r\n      Date.now() + \"-\" + runtime.agentId\r\n  ),\r\n  userId: runtime.agentId,\r\n  agentId: runtime.agentId,\r\n  content: {\r\n    text: \"Send me 60 USDI, my invoice is: fibt600000001pp8msdlfq6gqzg7dwfhddw3x46u2xydkgzm2e37kp6dr75yakkemrxjm67xjucccgj7hz46reg9m90gvax25pgfcrerysr67fesg34zzsu895nns8g78ua6x23f3w9xjyfzwht9grq5aa2vwaz0gaaxme6dqxfypk3g02753fc0a6e4e4jx7r982qv282mutcw8zzrx3y992av365sfv2pgpschnwn5wv3lglel8x96adqemcsp9j0l2rfue2rvp9yj60320wdewqj8aln2c3dh04s30nxg0hn0vufhdj8gkcvt5h4h8gfr02k8x6rnyulnlqgt5gqzmhkchn6tcqtgk0zkglgrl0wg8ede99gv204rgsqqjge9mq07u23f7vxfcdzpm57rt72359vp0yad9pkl5ttae44vxd5rzq09m2w8rc0ydryljywvgqj2gq0d\",\r\n    action: \"SEND_PAYMENT\",\r\n  },\r\n  roomId: runtime.agentId,\r\n  embedding: getEmbeddingZeroVector(),\r\n  createdAt: Date.now(),\r\n};\r\n\r\n// Process the message, it will trigger the SEND_PAYMENT action\r\n// callback is a function to handle the response (e.g., send the response back to the user)\r\nruntime.processActions(message, [], state, callback)\r\n\r\n```\r\n",

Review the core plugin structure in `index.ts`\r\n2. Check token transfer implementation in `actions/transfer.ts`\r\n3. Examine utility functions in `utils.ts`\r\n4. Review configuration validation and error handling\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Configure environment variables:\r\n```env\r\nQUAI_PRIVATE_KEY=your-quai-private-key\r\nQUAI_RPC_URL=https://rpc.quai.network\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Test token transfer:\r\n```typescript\r\nconst result = await eliza.execute({\r\n  action: 'SEND_TOKEN',\r\n  content: {\r\n    recipient: '0x049d36570d4e46f48e99674bd3fcc84644ddd6b96f7c741b1562b82f9e004dc7',\r\n    amount: '10'\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Verify address validation:\r\n- Test with invalid addresses\r\n- Test with null token addresses\r\n- Test with malformed addresses\r\n\r\n4. Check error handling:\r\n- Test with insufficient balance\r\n- Test with invalid network connection\r\n- Test with missing configuration\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n## Database changes\r\nNone - This plugin doesn't interact with any database\r\n\r\n## Deployment instructions\r\n1. Install dependencies:\r\n```bash\r\npnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Build the plugin:\r\n```bash\r\npnpm build\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Run tests:\r\n```bash\r\npnpm test\r\n```\r\n\r\n4. Ensure environment variables are properly configured in deployment environment\r\n\r\nThis PR sets up the foundation for Quai Network integration, focusing on secure and reliable token transfers while maintaining consistency with Eliza's plugin architecture.\r\n\r\n## Discord username\r\nalank7528",

Plain Kubernetes manifests: While this is being addressed in #1711, it requires more manual configuration and doesn't provide the package management benefits of Helm.\r\n2.

            "body": "Just starting working with the framework, maybe it's a basic question: how to keep long memory?\r\n\r\nFor example I want agent to remember something. Then I exchange many new messages. Then I want to get back to the thing I wanted agent to remember. Unfortunately it can only relate to some recent 20-40 (?) messages back.\r\n\r\nIs it a configuration thing? I use default configs.\r\n\r\nor this requires custom plugin that will remember \"todo\" list?\r\n\r\nwhich memory to use for that?\r\n\r\nif there are more items over the time - does it mean the openai or anthropic costs will increase due to bigger context or something similar?\r\n\r\nany ideas how to handle this?",
