Make sure to set a specific origin rather than `*`, otherwise any origin can access your development server.\n\n#### Using a reverse proxy in front of Vite\nIf you are using a reverse proxy in front of Vite and sending requests to Vite with a hostname other than `localhost` or `*.localhost`, you need to add the hostname to the new [`server.allowedHosts`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-allowedhosts) option. For example, if the reverse proxy is sending requests to `http://vite:5173`, you need to add `vite` to the `server.allowedHosts` option.\n\n#### Accessing the development server via a domain other than `localhost` or `*.localhost`\nYou need to add the hostname to the new [`server.allowedHosts`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-allowedhosts) option. For example, if you are accessing the development server via `http://foo.example.com:8080`, you need to add `foo.example.com` to the `server.allowedHosts` option.\n\n#### Using a plugin / framework that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser\nIf you are using a plugin / framework, try upgrading to a newer version of Vite that fixes the vulnerability. If the WebSocket connection appears not to be working, the plugin / framework may have a code that connects to the WebSocket server on their own from the browser.\n\nIn that case, you can either:\n\n- fix the plugin / framework code to the make it compatible with the new version of Vite\n- set `legacy.skipWebSocketTokenCheck: true` to opt-out the fix for [2] while the plugin / framework is incompatible with the new version of Vite\n  - When enabling this option, **make sure that you are aware of the security implications** described in the impact section of [2] above.\n\n### Mitigation without upgrading Vite\n\n#### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings\nSet `server.cors` to `false` or limit `server.cors.origin` to trusted origins.\n\n#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections\nThere aren't any mitigations for this.\n\n#### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests\nUse Chrome 94+ or use HTTPS for the development server.\n\n### Details\n\nThere are three causes that allowed malicious websites to send any requests to the development server:\n\n#### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings\n\nVite sets the [`Access-Control-Allow-Origin`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Access-Control-Allow-Origin) header depending on [`server.cors`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-cors) option. The default value was `true` which sets `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`. This allows websites on any origin to `fetch` contents served on the development server.\n\nAttack scenario:\n\n1. The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`).\n2. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n3. The attacker sends a `fetch('http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page. This request is normally blocked by same-origin policy, but that's not the case for the reasons above.\n4. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js`.\n\n#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections\n\nVite starts a WebSocket server to handle HMR and other functionalities. This WebSocket server [did not perform validation on the Origin header](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/v6.0.7/packages/vite/src/node/server/ws.ts#L145-L157) and was vulnerable to Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH) attacks. With that attack, an attacker can read and write messages on the WebSocket connection. Vite only sends some information over the WebSocket connection ([list of the file paths that changed, the file content where the errored happened, etc.](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/v6.0.7/packages/vite/types/hmrPayload.d.ts#L12-L72)), but plugins can send arbitrary messages and may include more sensitive information.\n\nAttack scenario:\n\n1. The attacker serves a malicious web page (`http://malicious.example.com`).\n2. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n3. The attacker runs `new WebSocket('http://127.0.0.1:5173', 'vite-hmr')` by JS in that malicious web page.\n4. The user edits some files.\n5. Vite sends some HMR messages over WebSocket.\n6. The attacker gets the content of the HMR messages.\n\n#### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests\n\nUnless [`server.https`](https://vite.dev/config/server-options.html#server-https) is set, Vite starts the development server on HTTP. Non-HTTPS servers are vulnerable to DNS rebinding attacks without validation on the Host header. But Vite did not perform validation on the Host header. By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can send arbitrary requests to the development server bypassing the same-origin policy.\n\n1. The attacker serves a malicious web page that is served on **HTTP** (`http://malicious.example.com:5173`) (HTTPS won't work).\n2. The user accesses the malicious web page.\n3. The attacker changes the DNS to point to 127.0.0.1 (or other private addresses).\n4. The attacker sends a `fetch('/main.js')` request by JS in that malicious web page.\n5. The attacker gets the content of `http://127.0.0.1:5173/main.js` bypassing the same origin policy.\n\n### Impact\n\n#### [1]: Permissive default CORS settings\nUsers with the default `server.cors` option may:\n\n- get the source code stolen by malicious websites\n- give the attacker access to functionalities that are not supposed to be exposed externally\n  - Vite core does not have any functionality that causes changes somewhere else when receiving a request, but plugins may implement those functionalities and servers behind `server.proxy` may have those functionalities.\n\n#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections\nAll users may get the file paths of the files that changed and the file content where the error happened be stolen by malicious websites.\n\nFor users that is using a plugin that sends messages over WebSocket, that content may be stolen by malicious websites.\n\nFor users that is using a plugin that has a functionality that is triggered by messages over WebSocket, that functionality may be exploited by malicious websites.\n\n#### [3]: Lack of validation on the Host header for HTTP requests\nUsers using HTTP for the development server and using a browser that is not Chrome 94+ may:\n\n- get the source code stolen by malicious websites\n- give the attacker access to functionalities that are not supposed to be exposed externally\n  - Vite core does not have any functionality that causes changes somewhere else when receiving a request, but plugins may implement those functionalities and servers behind `server.proxy` may have those functionalities.\n\nChrome 94+ users are not affected for [3], because [sending a request to a private network page from public non-HTTPS page is forbidden](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/private-network-access-update#chrome_94) since Chrome 94.\n\n### Related Information\nSafari has [a bug that blocks requests to loopback addresses from HTTPS origins](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=171934). This means when the user is using Safari and Vite is listening on lookback addresses, there's another condition of \"the malicious web page is served on HTTP\" to make [1] and [2] to work.\n\n### PoC\n\n#### [2]: Lack of validation on the Origin header for WebSocket connections\n1. I used the `react` template which utilizes HMR functionality.\n\n```\nnpm create vite@latest my-vue-app-react -- --template react\n```\n\n2. Then on a malicious server, serve the following POC html:\n```html\n<!doctype html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n    <head>\n        <meta charset=\"utf-8\" />\n        <title>vite CSWSH</title>\n    </head>\n    <body>\n        <div id=\"logs\"></div>\n        <script>\n            const div = document.querySelectorAll('#logs')[0];\n            const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:5173','vite-hmr');\n            ws.onmessage = event => {\n                const logLine = document.createElement('p');\n                logLine.innerHTML = event.data;\n                div.append(logLine);\n            };\n        </script>\n    </body>\n</html>\n```\n\n3. Kick off Vite \n\n```\nnpm run dev\n```\n\n4. Load the development server (open `http://localhost:5173/`) as well as the malicious page in the browser. \n5. Edit `src/App.jsx` file and intentionally place a syntax error\n6. Notice how the malicious page can view the websocket messages and a snippet of the source code is exposed\n\nHere's a video demonstrating the POC:\n\nhttps://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a4ad05cd-0b34-461c-9ff6-d7c8663d6961\n\n---\n\n### Release Notes\n\n<details>\n<summary>vitejs/vite (vite)</summary>\n\n### [`v5.4.12`](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/releases/tag/v5.4.12)\n\n[Compare Source](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/compare/v5.4.11...v5.4.12)\n\nPlease refer to [CHANGELOG.md](https://redirect.github.com/vitejs/vite/blob/v5.4.12/packages/vite/CHANGELOG.md) for details.\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n### Configuration\n\n📅 **Schedule**: Branch creation - \"\" in timezone UTC, Automerge - At any time (no schedule defined).\n\n🚦 **Automerge**: Disabled by config.

    "title": "Adding Active Inference module to ElizaOS",
    "body": "# Relates to\r\n\r\nImplementation of Active Inference (probabilistic cognitive modeling using perception and action) in ElizaOS. This plugin provides a standalone implementation of the Active Inference framework for modeling agent behavior under uncertainty.\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\n\r\nLow risk. This is a standalone plugin, and the code consists of conventional statistical models. The implementation:\r\n- Uses well-tested mathematical libraries (mathjs)\r\n- Has no direct system access or privileged operations\r\n- Is isolated from other ElizaOS components\r\n- Contains only pure computational functions\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n\r\nThis PR introduces a TypeScript implementation of Active Inference, a computational framework for modeling perception and action in cognitive systems. Key features include:\r\n\r\n1. Core Active Inference Engine:\r\n   - Belief updating through variational inference\r\n   - Action selection via expected free energy minimization\r\n   - Configurable model parameters and learning rates\r\n\r\n2. Two-State World Example:\r\n   - Demonstrates safe/dangerous state inference\r\n   - Shows action selection between stay/move behaviors\r\n   - Includes observation-driven belief updates\r\n\r\n3. Visualization Tools:\r\n   - Real-time belief evolution tracking\r\n   - Expected free energy visualization\r\n   - State transition analysis\r\n   - Interactive HTML reports\r\n\r\n4. Logging and Debugging:\r\n   - Detailed model parameter logging\r\n   - Step-by-step inference tracking\r\n   - Matrix operation validation\r\n   - Belief state interpretation\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\n\r\nFeature addition. This PR adds a new cognitive modeling capability to ElizaOS through a self-contained plugin.\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\n\r\nWe are doing this to provide a standalone implementation of Active Inference in ElizaOS. This is a foundational capability for the ElizaOS project, and it will allow us to model agent behavior under uncertainty.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\n\r\nYes. The following documentation has been added:\r\n\r\n1. README.md in the plugin directory explaining:\r\n   - Active Inference theory and implementation\r\n   - Usage examples and API documentation\r\n   - Configuration options\r\n   - Visualization guide\r\n\r\n2. Code Documentation:\r\n   - TypeScript interfaces and type definitions\r\n   - Function documentation with mathematical explanations\r\n   - Example code with comments\r\n   - Visualization script documentation\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n\r\n1. Review the core implementation:\r\n   - src/inference.ts - Main Active Inference implementation\r\n   - src/types.ts - Type definitions and interfaces\r\n   - src/utils/inference-visualizations.ts - Visualization utilities\r\n\r\n2. Examine the example:\r\n   - src/examples/standalone_example.ts - Complete working example\r\n   - Output/plot_results.py - Visualization generation\r\n   - Generated HTML report and plots\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n\r\n1. Setup and Installation:\r\n```bash\r\ncd packages/plugin-inference\r\nnpm install\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run the standalone example:\r\n```bash\r\npython3 src/examples/standalone_example.py\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. Verify outputs:\r\n- Check Output/inference_log.txt for detailed execution log\r\n- Open Output/results.html to view visualizations\r\n- Verify belief evolution and free energy plots\r\n- Examine state transition matrices\r\n\r\n4. Validation criteria:\r\n- Belief updates should be mathematically sound\r\n- Action selection should minimize expected free energy\r\n- Visualizations should be clear and informative\r\n- HTML report should be well-formatted and complete\r\n\r\n5. Test different scenarios:\r\n- Modify observation patterns\r\n- Adjust model parameters\r\n- Verify behavior changes\r\n\r\n# Deploy Notes\r\n\r\nNo special deployment steps required. The plugin is self-contained and requires only:\r\n- Node.js environment\r\n- Python 3.x with matplotlib, numpy, and pandas\r\n- Standard npm dependencies\r\n\r\nThe plugin can be installed as a regular npm package and imported into any TypeScript/JavaScript project.\r\n\r\n<!-- If you are on Discord, please join https://discord.gg/ai16z and state your Discord username here for the contributor role and join us in #development-feed -->\r\n<!--\r\n## Discord username\r\n\r\ndocxology\r\n",

    "title": "Official SimsAI Release V1.0",
    "body": "### Relates to\r\n\r\nN/A\r\nExpand Eliza's social capabilities on a large social agent backroom and agent only social\r\n\r\n### Risks\r\n\r\nLow. While this PR introduces a new external integration with SimsAI, it is isolated from core Eliza functionality and should not pose any risks to existing features. Potential edge cases to monitor:\r\n\r\nHandling of API rate limiting or errors from SimsAI\r\nEnsuring agent responses stay within acceptable content guidelines\r\nManaging memory usage if processing very long conversation threads\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\n**What does this PR do?**\r\nThis PR adds a full integration with SimsAI's Jeeter social network, turning Eliza agents into social chatbots. Key capabilities unlocked:\r\n\r\nAgents can post unprompted messages to their Jeeter timeline on a configurable 1-3 hour interval (via JeeterPostClient)\r\nAgents monitor Jeeter for posts mentioning them or replying to their posts, and generate relevant responses (via JeeterInteractionClient)\r\nAgents proactively search for Jeeter posts related to their topics of expertise and engage with those conversations (via JeeterSearchClient)\r\n\r\nEliza agents use their existing knowledge, tone, and roleplay parameters to inform their Jeeter interactions. This allows them to build a social presence that aligns with and extends their base identity.\r\nWhat kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nWhy are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nSocial interaction capabilities have been a highly requested feature for Eliza agents. Integrating with SimsAI's Jeeter platform lets us quickly enable social behaviors without having to build out chat infrastructure ourselves.\r\nThis positions Eliza as the leading framework for creating AI social agents and chatbots. Developers can now build agents that engage in open-ended public conversations, not just 1:1 private chats.\r\nThis initial SimsAI integration lays the groundwork for potential future social platform integrations. The JeeterPostClient, JeeterSearchClient and JeeterInteractionClient abstractions can likely be repurposed for other social APIs.\r\n\r\n**Documentation changes needed?**\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nThe following additions are needed to the \"Integrations\" section of the Eliza documentation:\r\n\r\n Overview of the SimsAI integration and high-level capabilities it enables\r\n Setup guide with required environment variables:\r\n\r\nSIMSAI_USERNAME - Jeeter username for the agent\r\nSIMSAI_API_KEY - SimsAI API key\r\nSIMSAI_AGENT_ID - ID of the agent on SimsAI\r\n\r\n Setup guide with required client addition:\r\nADDITION OF CLIENT - 'simsai'  added to the client section of the character file\r\n\r\n\r\n Explanation of the JeeterPostClient, JeeterSearchClient, and JeeterInteractionClient with config options\r\n Adding Jeeter capabilities to an agent via simsai.character.json\r\n\r\nSpecifying agent bio, lore, example messages, topics of expertise\r\n\r\n\r\n FAQ covering common use cases, troubleshooting, and best practices\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n**Where should a reviewer start?**\r\n\r\nStart by reviewing the SimsAIManager class in index.ts to understand the overall architecture. This class initializes the individual client components:\r\n\r\n**JeeterPostClient** - Posting messages to the agent's timeline\r\n**JeeterSearchClient** - Searching Jeeter for relevant conversations\r\n**JeeterInteractionClient** - Replying to messages that mention or reply to the agent\r\n\r\nNext, dive into each of those client implementations to review the core behaviors:\r\n\r\n**Fetching data from SimsAI APIs**\r\nGenerating agent responses using Eliza's existing dialog engine\r\nHandling edge cases and errors\r\n\r\nFinally, take a look at simsai.character.json to see how Jeeter-specific agent attributes are configured.\r\nDetailed testing steps\r\n\r\nAs a user with a SimsAI account, go to https://www.simsai.io/account\r\n\r\nCopy your API key and Agent ID from the account settings page\r\n\r\n\r\n**As a developer, configure the agent:**\r\n\r\nSet the SIMSAI_USERNAME, SIMSAI_API_KEY and SIMSAI_AGENT_ID environment variables\r\nUpdate the agent's simsai.character.json file with desired name, bio, topics etc\r\n\r\n\r\n**Run the agent locally**\r\n\r\nIn the terminal, verify the agent successfully authenticates with SimsAI\r\nVerify the JeeterPostClient, JeeterSearchClient and JeeterInteractionClient all activate successfully\r\nMonitor the logs to ensure the agent is regularly posting, searching and replying\r\n\r\n\r\n**On Jeeter, look at the agent interactions:**\r\n\r\nCheck the agent's timeline at https://jeeter.social/<agent_username>\r\n\r\nVerify new posts appear every 1-3 hours\r\nVerify posts align with the agent's configured tone, knowledge and examples\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a new post mentioning the agent's @username\r\n\r\nWithin 2-5 minutes, verify the agent replies with a relevant message\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reply to one of the agent's posts**\r\n\r\nWithin 2-5 minutes, verify the agent responds and continues the conversation\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate posts related to the agent's configured topics\r\n\r\nWithin 5-10 minutes, verify the agent finds and engages with those posts\r\n\r\n**Provision the agent with the following required environment variables:**\r\n\r\nSIMSAI_USERNAME - Jeeter username for the agent\r\nSIMSAI_API_KEY - SimsAI API key (generated at https://www.simsai.io/account)\r\nSIMSAI_AGENT_ID - ID of the agent on SimsAI (provided during agent creation)\r\n\r\nConfigure the agent's tone, knowledge, example messages and conversational hooks in its simsai.character.json file. See documentation for the available options.\r\nDeploy the agent per standard Eliza deployment practices.

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Tips</summary>\n\n### Chat\n\nThere are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):\n\n- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

    "body": "### Relates to\r\n\r\nN/A\r\nExpand Eliza's social capabilities on a large social agent backroom and agent only social\r\n\r\n### Risks\r\n\r\nLow. While this PR introduces a new external integration with SimsAI, it is isolated from core Eliza functionality and should not pose any risks to existing features. Potential edge cases to monitor:\r\n\r\nHandling of API rate limiting or errors from SimsAI\r\nEnsuring agent responses stay within acceptable content guidelines\r\nManaging memory usage if processing very long conversation threads\r\n\r\n### Background\r\n\r\n**What does this PR do?**\r\nThis PR adds a full integration with SimsAI's Jeeter social network, turning Eliza agents into social chatbots. Key capabilities unlocked:\r\n\r\nAgents can post unprompted messages to their Jeeter timeline on a configurable 1-3 hour interval (via JeeterPostClient)\r\nAgents monitor Jeeter for posts mentioning them or replying to their posts, and generate relevant responses (via JeeterInteractionClient)\r\nAgents proactively search for Jeeter posts related to their topics of expertise and engage with those conversations (via JeeterSearchClient)\r\n\r\nEliza agents use their existing knowledge, tone, and roleplay parameters to inform their Jeeter interactions. This allows them to build a social presence that aligns with and extends their base identity.\r\nWhat kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nWhy are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nSocial interaction capabilities have been a highly requested feature for Eliza agents. Integrating with SimsAI's Jeeter platform lets us quickly enable social behaviors without having to build out chat infrastructure ourselves.\r\nThis positions Eliza as the leading framework for creating AI social agents and chatbots. Developers can now build agents that engage in open-ended public conversations, not just 1:1 private chats.\r\nThis initial SimsAI integration lays the groundwork for potential future social platform integrations. The JeeterPostClient, JeeterSearchClient and JeeterInteractionClient abstractions can likely be repurposed for other social APIs.\r\n\r\n**Documentation changes needed?**\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nThe following additions are needed to the \"Integrations\" section of the Eliza documentation:\r\n\r\n Overview of the SimsAI integration and high-level capabilities it enables\r\n Setup guide with required environment variables:\r\n\r\nSIMSAI_USERNAME - Jeeter username for the agent\r\nSIMSAI_API_KEY - SimsAI API key\r\nSIMSAI_AGENT_ID - ID of the agent on SimsAI\r\n\r\n Setup guide with required client addition:\r\nADDITION OF CLIENT - 'simsai'  added to the client section of the character file\r\n\r\n\r\n Explanation of the JeeterPostClient, JeeterSearchClient, and JeeterInteractionClient with config options\r\n Adding Jeeter capabilities to an agent via simsai.character.json\r\n\r\nSpecifying agent bio, lore, example messages, topics of expertise\r\n\r\n\r\n FAQ covering common use cases, troubleshooting, and best practices\r\n\r\n### Testing\r\n\r\n**Where should a reviewer start?**\r\n\r\nStart by reviewing the SimsAIManager class in index.ts to understand the overall architecture. This class initializes the individual client components:\r\n\r\n**JeeterPostClient** - Posting messages to the agent's timeline\r\n**JeeterSearchClient** - Searching Jeeter for relevant conversations\r\n**JeeterInteractionClient** - Replying to messages that mention or reply to the agent\r\n\r\nNext, dive into each of those client implementations to review the core behaviors:\r\n\r\n**Fetching data from SimsAI APIs**\r\nGenerating agent responses using Eliza's existing dialog engine\r\nHandling edge cases and errors\r\n\r\nFinally, take a look at simsai.character.json to see how Jeeter-specific agent attributes are configured.\r\nDetailed testing steps\r\n\r\nAs a user with a SimsAI account, go to https://www.simsai.io/account\r\n\r\nCopy your API key and Agent ID from the account settings page\r\n\r\n\r\n**As a developer, configure the agent:**\r\n\r\nSet the SIMSAI_USERNAME, SIMSAI_API_KEY and SIMSAI_AGENT_ID environment variables\r\nUpdate the agent's simsai.character.json file with desired name, bio, topics etc\r\n\r\n\r\n**Run the agent locally**\r\n\r\nIn the terminal, verify the agent successfully authenticates with SimsAI\r\nVerify the JeeterPostClient, JeeterSearchClient and JeeterInteractionClient all activate successfully\r\nMonitor the logs to ensure the agent is regularly posting, searching and replying\r\n\r\n\r\n**On Jeeter, look at the agent interactions:**\r\n\r\nCheck the agent's timeline at https://jeeter.social/<agent_username>\r\n\r\nVerify new posts appear every 1-3 hours\r\nVerify posts align with the agent's configured tone, knowledge and examples\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate a new post mentioning the agent's @username\r\n\r\nWithin 2-5 minutes, verify the agent replies with a relevant message\r\n\r\n\r\n**Reply to one of the agent's posts**\r\n\r\nWithin 2-5 minutes, verify the agent responds and continues the conversation\r\n\r\n\r\nCreate posts related to the agent's configured topics\r\n\r\nWithin 5-10 minutes, verify the agent finds and engages with those posts\r\n\r\n**Provision the agent with the following required environment variables:**\r\n\r\nSIMSAI_USERNAME - Jeeter username for the agent\r\nSIMSAI_API_KEY - SimsAI API key (generated at https://www.simsai.io/account)\r\nSIMSAI_AGENT_ID - ID of the agent on SimsAI (provided during agent creation)\r\n\r\nConfigure the agent's tone, knowledge, example messages and conversational hooks in its simsai.character.json file. See documentation for the available options.\r\nDeploy the agent per standard Eliza deployment practices. No additional infrastructure or dependencies are required for the SimsAI integration.\r\nOnce deployed, verify the agent begins posting and interacting on Jeeter within 10 minutes. Monitor the agent's Jeeter timeline at https://jeeter.social/<agent_username>\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if you have any other questions or feedback on the PR description! I'm happy to clarify or expand on any part of it.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1494\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-21 at 12 15 29 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9d2e9fb6-4f6b-4902-babf-f32dc4090805\" />\r\n<img width=\"1547\" alt=\"Screenshot 2025-01-21 at 12 15 18 PM\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d5f00c2d-4135-4395-befc-13025c1d594a\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\r\n\r\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\r\n\r\nBased on the comprehensive changes, here are the release notes:\r\n\r\n- **New Features**\r\n  - Added SimsAI client integration for social media-like interactions\r\n  - Introduced new character profile with enhanced interaction capabilities\r\n  - Implemented Jeeter platform interaction support\r\n\r\n- **Configuration Updates**\r\n  - Added new environment variables for SimsAI and Story API configurations\r\n  - Updated package configurations for client-simsai package\r\n\r\n- **Development Improvements**\r\n  - Enhanced type definitions and utility functions\r\n  - Added new ESLint and TypeScript configurations\r\n  - Improved error handling and logging mechanisms\r\n\r\n- **Character Enhancements**\r\n  - Added a new ethereal-being-bot character with mystical persona\r\n  - Expanded character profile capabilities with SimsAI integration\r\n\r\nThe release introduces a comprehensive SimsAI client platform with advanced interaction capabilities, focusing on flexible and intelligent social media-like engagement.\r\n\r\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",

The changes span multiple packages, adding configuration, client implementations, and type definitions for interacting with a social media-like platform called \"Jeeter\". The implementation includes clients for posting, searching, and managing interactions, along with robust error handling and configuration validation.\n\n## Changes\n\n| File | Change Summary |\n|------|----------------|\n| `.env.example` | Added configuration variables for Story and SimsAI APIs |\n| `agent/package.json` | Added `@elizaos/client-simsai` workspace dependency |\n| `agent/src/index.ts` | Imported new Jeeter client interface, minor formatting updates |\n| `characters/simsai.character.json` | Added new \"ethereal-being-bot\" character configuration |\n| `packages/client-simsai/*` | Created new package with comprehensive client implementation for SimsAI/Jeeter platform |\n| `packages/core/src/types.ts` | Updated types to support SimsAI profile and

Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

This involves deleting the entire plugin package, removing its configuration entries, eliminating import statements, and cleaning up related workflow and dependency references. The changes suggest a complete deprecation of the Initia Plugin functionality across the project's infrastructure.\n\n## Changes\n\n| File | Change Summary |\n|------|----------------|\n| `.env.example` | Removed Initia Plugin configuration entries |\n| `.github/workflows/integrationTests.yaml` | Updated Node.js and pnpm versions, added caching, modified environment variables |\n| `.github/workflows/smoke-tests.yml` | Updated to use Node.js container, upgraded pnpm version, added dependency caching |\n| `agent/package.json` | Removed `@elizaos/plugin-initia` dependency |\n| `agent/src/index.ts` | Removed `initiaPlugin` import |\n| `packages/plugin-initia/` | Completely removed plugin package, including README, package configuration, source files, and TypeScript configuration |\n\n## Possibly related PRs\n\n- #2448: Introduced the Initia Plugin initially\n- #1865: Previously removed Initia Plugin dependency\n- #2086: Modified plugin management in

comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

The changes span multiple files, introducing new environment variables, actions for AI image detection, deepfake analysis, content safety, and more. The plugin provides a robust framework for leveraging NVIDIA's AI Foundation Models with detailed configuration options and error handling.\n\n## Changes\n\n| File | Change Summary |\n|------|----------------|\n| `.env.example` | Added NVIDIA-specific configuration variables for NIM environment, API keys, logging, and model settings |\n| `agent/package.json` | Added `@elizaos/plugin-nvidia-nim` as a workspace dependency |\n| `agent/src/index.ts` | Conditionally imported and added NVIDIA NIM plugin based on API key presence |\n| `packages/plugin-nvidia-nim/*` | Created entire plugin structure with actions, types, utilities, and configuration files |\n\n## Possibly related PRs\n\n- #2121: Similar configuration enhancement for platform settings\n- #2512:

Tips</summary>\n\n### Chat\n\nThere are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):\n\n- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks.

The modifications include updates to configuration files, package definitions, and integration of these plugins into the agent's core functionality.\n\n## Changes\n\n| File | Change Summary |\n|------|----------------|\n| `agent/package.json` | Added dependencies: `@elizaos/plugin-pear` and `@elizaos/plugin-news` |\n| `agent/src/index.ts` | Imported and added `pearPlugin` and `NewsPlugin` to plugins |\n| `characters/tate.character.json` | Updated `clients` to include \"telegram\" and changed `modelProvider` to \"openai\" |\n| `client/*` | Various UI and styling updates |\n| `packages/plugin-pear` and `packages/plugin-news` | New plugin packages with actions, evaluators, and providers |\n\n## Possibly related PRs\n\n- #2095: Adds dependencies to `agent/package.json`\n- #2298: Introduces a new plugin and modifies agent initialization\n- #2463: Adds another plugin to agent functionality\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- walkthrough_end -->\n\n---\n\n<details>\n<summary>📜 Recent review details</summary>\n\n**Configuration used: CodeRabbit UI**\n**Review profile: CHILL**\n**Plan: Pro**\n\n<details>\n<summary>📥 Commits</summary>\n\nReviewing files that changed from the base of the PR and between a00f7237542b734e239de539bb3ee99271542ab7 and 84f16b9650a3895ce987aec6696b2625181c462a.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>⛔ Files ignored due to path filters (1)</summary>\n\n* `pnpm-lock.yaml` is excluded by `!**/pnpm-lock.yaml`\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>📒 Files selected for processing (47)</summary>\n\n* `agent/package.json` (1 hunks)\n* `agent/src/index.ts` (2 hunks)\n* `characters/tate.character.json` (1 hunks)\n* `client/src/Agents.tsx` (1 hunks)\n* `client/src/App.css` (0 hunks)\n* `client/src/App.tsx` (1 hunks)\n* `client/src/Chat.tsx` (4 hunks)\n* `client/src/api/queries/useGetAgentsQuery.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `output.txt` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/client-telegram/src/index.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/core/src/defaultCharacter.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/core/src/types.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-news/.npmignore` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-news/README.md` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-news/eslint.config.mjs` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-news/package.json` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-news/src/actions/cryptoNews.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-news/src/actions/cryptoPrice.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-news/src/actions/index.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-news/src/actions/intentData.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-news/src/actions/intentDataTypes.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-news/src/actions/pearNews.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-news/src/evaluators/fact.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-news/src/evaluators/goal.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-news/src/evaluators/index.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-news/src/index.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-news/src/providers/boredom.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-news/src/providers/facts.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-news/src/providers/index.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-news/src/providers/time.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-news/tsconfig.json` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-news/tsup.config.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-pear/.npmignore` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-pear/README.md` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-pear/eslint.config.mjs` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-pear/package.json` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-pear/src/actions/pear.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-pear/src/evaluators/fact.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-pear/src/evaluators/index.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-pear/src/index.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-pear/src/providers/boredom.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-pear/src/providers/facts.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-pear/src/providers/index.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-pear/src/providers/time.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-pear/tsconfig.json` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-pear/tsup.config.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `pk.txt` (1 hunks)\n\n</details>\n\n</details>\n<!-- finishing_touch_checkbox_start -->\n\n<details>\n<summary>✨ Finishing Touches</summary>\n\n- [ ] <!-- {\"checkboxId\": \"7962f53c-55bc-4827-bfbf-6a18da830691\"} --> 📝 Generate Docstrings (Beta)\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- finishing_touch_checkbox_end -->\n<!-- tips_start -->\n\n---\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>🪧 Tips</summary>\n\n### Chat\n\nThere are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):\n\n- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

    "title": "feat: chainbase plugin for eliza",
    "body": "# Relates to\r\nEliza AI agents, blockchain data analytics, Chainbase\r\n\r\n# Risks\r\nLow. This is a new feature that adds functionality without disrupting existing systems.\r\n\r\n# Background\r\n## What does this PR do? \r\nThis PR introduces a new Chainbase plugin for Eliza that enables AI agents to access and analyze blockchain data across multiple networks using natural language queries. The plugin leverages Chainbase's comprehensive data infrastructure to provide real-time insights.\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\n\r\n## Why are we doing this? Any context or related work?\r\nEliza AI agents currently lack the ability to easily access and analyze on-chain data, especially across multiple blockchain networks. This plugin bridges that gap by allowing users to query blockchain data using natural language without requiring deep technical blockchain knowledge. It unlocks powerful new analytics and insight generation capabilities for Eliza.\r\n\r\nThis work builds upon Chainbase's existing multi-chain data infrastructure and Eliza's natural language processing capabilities. It is part of the broader initiative to make blockchain data more accessible and actionable for end users.\r\n\r\n# Documentation changes needed?\r\nMy changes require a change to the project documentation.\r\nI have updated the documentation to include:\r\n- Overview of the Chainbase plugin and its purpose\r\n- Installation and configuration instructions \r\n- Examples of natural language queries and the blockchain insights generated\r\n- API reference for key functions\r\n\r\n# Testing\r\n## Where should a reviewer start?\r\n1. Review the updated documentation to understand the purpose and functionality of the plugin\r\n2. Run the automated test suite: `npm run test`\r\n3. Follow the instructions to install and configure the plugin in a dev environment\r\n4. Test sample natural language queries against blockchain data and verify the insights generated match expected results\r\n5. Review the code changes, focusing on the integration between Eliza's NLP and Chainbase's data layer\r\n\r\n## Detailed testing steps\r\n1. Install and configure the Chainbase plugin by following the documentation \r\n2. From the Eliza interface, input a natural language query such as \"What is the total transaction volume on Ethereum in the last 24 hours?\" \r\n3. Verify the plugin converts this to the appropriate Chainbase query and returns the expected analytics\r\n4. Test queries across multiple supported blockchain networks \r\n5. Verify error handling for unsupported networks or malformed queries\r\n6. Run edge case tests from the automated test suite and ensure code coverage meets standards\r\n\r\n# Deployment instructions\r\n1. Merge PR after review and testing approval\r\n2. Update Eliza production environment to point to the new Chainbase plugin version\r\n3. Restart Eliza web servers\r\n4. Smoke test Chainbase queries from the production Eliza interface \r\n5. Monitor error logs and system metrics post-deployment to ensure stability\r\n\r\nLet me know if you need any other information to include in the PR description! I aimed to be thorough while following the provided template.\r\n\r\n# Screenshot\r\n<img width=\"979\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a53778fc-45a1-43b1-9417-2d4dc622b6ed\" />\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1205\" alt=\"image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/869d781e-96d4-459e-82c1-a16f18e1c2b1\" />\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n<!-- This is an auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->\n\n## Summary by CodeRabbit\n\n- **New Features**\n\t- Added Chainbase Plugin for blockchain data querying\n\t- Introduced new configuration options for Instagram integration\n\t- Added support for retrieving token balances and on-chain data querying\n\n- **Configuration Updates**\n\t- Added Chainbase API key configuration\n\t- Expanded Instagram-related environment variables\n\t- Added new plugin dependency for Chainbase integration\n\n- **Documentation**\n\t- Created README for Chainbase Plugin\n\t- Detailed usage instructions for blockchain data interactions\n\n<!-- end of auto-generated comment: release notes by coderabbit.ai -->",

expanding the platform's blockchain data interaction capabilities. The changes include adding a new plugin package, updating the agent's configuration, and implementing actions for querying blockchain data and retrieving token balances. The modifications seamlessly integrate Chainbase functionality into the existing system, providing enhanced on-chain data access through natural language queries.\n\n## Changes\n\n| File | Change Summary |\n|------|----------------|\n| `.env.example` | Added Chainbase API key and Instagram configuration parameters |\n| `agent/package.json` | Added `@elizaos/plugin-chainbase` dependency |\n| `agent/src/index.ts` | Imported Chainbase plugin, conditionally included in agent setup |\n| `packages/plugin-chainbase/*` | Created new plugin package with actions, libraries, and configuration |\n\n## Possibly related PRs\n\n- #1417: Introduces configuration changes similar to Chainbase plugin integration\n- #1865: Enhances plugin conditional inclusion mechanism\n- #2429: Expands plugin capabilities through configuration\n\n## Suggested Labels\n\n`Needs Testing`, `Plugin_new`\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- walkthrough_end -->\n\n---\n\n<details>\n<summary>📜 Recent review details</summary>\n\n**Configuration used: CodeRabbit UI**\n**Review profile: CHILL**\n**Plan: Pro**\n\n<details>\n<summary>📥 Commits</summary>\n\nReviewing files that changed from the base of the PR and between a00f7237542b734e239de539bb3ee99271542ab7 and 90a443bcf5e5b9d4f5187f3501d76c75edbc529a.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>⛔ Files ignored due to path filters (4)</summary>\n\n* `docs/package-lock.json` is excluded by `!**/package-lock.json`\n* `packages/core/package-lock.json` is excluded by `!**/package-lock.json`\n* `packages/create-eliza-app/package-lock.json` is excluded by `!**/package-lock.json`\n* `scripts/jsdoc-automation/package-lock.json` is excluded by `!**/package-lock.json`\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>📒 Files selected for processing (16)</summary>\n\n* `.env.example` (1 hunks)\n* `agent/package.json` (1 hunks)\n* `agent/src/index.ts` (2 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-chainbase/README.md` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-chainbase/eslint.config.mjs` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-chainbase/package.json` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-chainbase/src/actions/queryData.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-chainbase/src/actions/retrieveTokenBalance.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-chainbase/src/constants.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-chainbase/src/index.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-chainbase/src/libs/chainbase.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-chainbase/src/templates/index.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-chainbase/src/types.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-chainbase/src/utils.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-chainbase/tsconfig.json` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-chainbase/tsup.config.ts` (1 hunks)\n\n</details>\n\n</details>\n<!-- finishing_touch_checkbox_start -->\n\n<details>\n<summary>✨ Finishing Touches</summary>\n\n- [ ] <!-- {\"checkboxId\": \"7962f53c-55bc-4827-bfbf-6a18da830691\"} --> 📝 Generate Docstrings (Beta)\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- finishing_touch_checkbox_end -->\n<!-- tips_start -->\n\n---\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>🪧 Tips</summary>\n\n### Chat\n\nThere are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):\n\n- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Tips</summary>\n\n### Chat\n\nThere are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):\n\n- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"

Tips</summary>\n\n### Chat\n\nThere are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):\n\n- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR.

plugin for interacting with Merlin-compatible blockchain chains. The plugin focuses on BRC20 token minting through the BTCFUN API, providing actions, providers, and configuration files. It includes a comprehensive setup with TypeScript configuration, build tools, and environment-specific settings for seamless integration with Bitcoin-related token operations.\n\n## Changes\n\n| File | Change Summary |\n|------|----------------|\n| `README.md` | New documentation for Merlin plugin, detailing configuration and environment setup |\n| `eslint.config.mjs` | Added ESLint configuration extending global settings |\n| `package.json` | Created package definition with dependencies and scripts |\n| `src/actions/btcfun.ts` | Implemented `btcfunMintAction` for BRC20 token minting |\n| `src/index.ts` | Defined `merlinPlugin` with actions and exports |\n| `src/providers/btcfun.ts` | Created `BtcfunProvider` with API interaction methods |\n| `src/templates/index.ts` | Added `mintTemplate` for standardized token swap requests |\n| `tsconfig.json` | Configured TypeScript compilation settings |\n| `tsup.config.ts` | Set up build configuration for the plugin |\n\n## Possibly related PRs\n\n- #1865: Dex Screener plugin with token price actions\n- #2298: AgentKit plugin for NFT and token management\n- #2340: Solana plugin improvements for token transfers\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- walkthrough_end -->\n\n---\n\n<details>\n<summary>📜 Recent review details</summary>\n\n**Configuration used: CodeRabbit UI**\n**Review profile: CHILL**\n**Plan: Pro**\n\n<details>\n<summary>📥 Commits</summary>\n\nReviewing files that changed from the base of the PR and between a00f7237542b734e239de539bb3ee99271542ab7 and 7b12875bb3af930d73beb839978668d7ad8f3111.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary>📒 Files selected for processing (9)</summary>\n\n* `packages/plugin-merlin/README.md` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-merlin/eslint.config.mjs` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-merlin/package.json` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-merlin/src/actions/btcfun.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-merlin/src/index.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-merlin/src/providers/btcfun.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-merlin/src/templates/index.ts` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-merlin/tsconfig.json` (1 hunks)\n* `packages/plugin-merlin/tsup.config.ts` (1 hunks)\n\n</details>\n\n</details>\n<!-- finishing_touch_checkbox_start -->\n\n<details>\n<summary>✨ Finishing Touches</summary>\n\n- [ ] <!-- {\"checkboxId\": \"7962f53c-55bc-4827-bfbf-6a18da830691\"} --> 📝 Generate Docstrings (Beta)\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- finishing_touch_checkbox_end -->\n<!-- tips_start -->\n\n---\n\n\n\n<details>\n<summary>🪧 Tips</summary>\n\n### Chat\n\nThere are 3 ways to chat with [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai):\n\n- Review comments: Directly reply to a review comment made by CodeRabbit. Example:\n  - `I pushed a fix in commit <commit_id>, please review it.`\n  - `Generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  - `Open a follow-up GitHub issue for this discussion.`\n- Files and specific lines of code (under the \"Files changed\" tab): Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new review comment at the desired location with your query. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai generate unit testing code for this file.`\n  -\t`@coderabbitai modularize this function.`\n- PR comments: Tag `@coderabbitai` in a new PR comment to ask questions about the PR branch. For the best results, please provide a very specific query, as very limited context is provided in this mode. Examples:\n  - `@coderabbitai gather interesting stats about this repository and render them as a table. Additionally, render a pie chart showing the language distribution in the codebase.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read src/utils.ts and generate unit testing code.`\n  - `@coderabbitai read the files in the src/scheduler package and generate a class diagram using mermaid and a README in the markdown format.`\n  - `@coderabbitai help me debug CodeRabbit configuration file.`\n\nNote: Be mindful of the bot's finite context window. It's strongly recommended to break down tasks such as reading entire modules into smaller chunks. For a focused discussion, use review comments to chat about specific files and their changes, instead of using the PR comments.\n\n### CodeRabbit Commands (Invoked using PR comments)\n\n- `@coderabbitai pause` to pause the reviews on a PR.\n- `@coderabbitai resume` to resume the paused reviews.\n- `@coderabbitai review` to trigger an incremental review. This is useful when automatic reviews are disabled for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai full review` to do a full review from scratch and review all the files again.\n- `@coderabbitai summary` to regenerate the summary of the PR.\n- `@coderabbitai generate docstrings` to [generate docstrings](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/finishing-touches/docstrings) for this PR. ([Beta](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/early-access#beta))\n- `@coderabbitai resolve` resolve all the CodeRabbit review comments.\n- `@coderabbitai configuration` to show the current CodeRabbit configuration for the repository.\n- `@coderabbitai help` to get help.\n\n### Other keywords and placeholders\n\n- Add `@coderabbitai ignore` anywhere in the PR description to prevent this PR from being reviewed.\n- Add `@coderabbitai summary` to generate the high-level summary at a specific location in the PR description.\n- Add `@coderabbitai` anywhere in the PR title to generate the title automatically.\n\n### CodeRabbit Configuration File (`.coderabbit.yaml`)\n\n- You can programmatically configure CodeRabbit by adding a `.coderabbit.yaml` file to the root of your repository.\n- Please see the [configuration documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai/guides/configure-coderabbit) for more information.\n- If your editor has YAML language server enabled, you can add the path at the top of this file to enable auto-completion and validation: `# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://coderabbit.ai/integrations/schema.v2.json`\n\n### Documentation and Community\n\n- Visit our [Documentation](https://docs.coderabbit.ai) for detailed information on how to use CodeRabbit.\n- Join our [Discord Community](http://discord.gg/coderabbit) to get help, request features, and share feedback.\n- Follow us on [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/coderabbitai) for updates and announcements.\n\n</details>\n\n<!-- tips_end -->"
