List what kind of risks, and what could be effected.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n# Background\r\nFor a production ready - multi-character Eliza setup, we want to load new characters in runtime via API calls.\r\nWe do not want to restart the Eliza server for each new character.\r\n\r\n_ASSUMPTION:_ \r\nAn api or script exists to store the characters in DB.\r\nThe api uses the same stringToUUID method to create consistent UUIDs for a character and store in DB.\r\n\r\n## What does this PR do?\r\n- Allows loading characters from DB during start\r\n- Allows loading characters via REST API from DB during runtime\r\n- The characters are stored in TEXT/JSONB format - similar to the character Agent file in sqlite and postgres respectively\r\n- Securely encrypts each character's secrets using AES-256 encryption and then stores in DB (Decrypt after fetch)\r\n- Proper error handling for all scenarios \r\n    - Character already loaded in runtime\r\n    - Character does not exist in db\r\n\r\n## What kind of change is this?\r\nThis is a new Feature\r\n\r\nWhy?\r\nCurrently \r\n1) For adding any new agent, we need to restart the Eliza server => All the agents and its clients are loaded again - All previous tweets (incase of twitter client), interactions are processed again. Any existing direct or telegram conversation is lost. \r\n2) Not a straight-forward mechanism to add new agents - Now with a REST API - load new agents.\r\n\r\nWhy are we doing this?\r\nTo take a step towards multi-character production setup\r\n\r\n### Code Changes made and why?\r\n1. **Created a new table in postgres and sqlite** - Added in the seed file/script of both DBs\r\n`\r\nexport type CharacterTable = {\r\n    id: UUID;                                                // created from stringToUUID - unique and consistent for name\r\n    name: string;\r\n    characterState: Character;                 // A JSONB or TEXT - that maps the character\r\n    secretsIV?: Secrets;                            // Initialisation Vector for each secrets\r\n};\r\n`\r\n**Also added the above in packages/core/src/types.ts**\r\n2. **in SqliteAdapter and PostgresAdapter** - created a new function to load from this characters table\r\n3. **in Agents/src/index.ts** -> \r\n- Assign Directclient to a global variable - along with set and get methods. This is to allow the same direct client be used for character(agent) runtime creation\r\n- A function loadCharactersFromDb loadCharactersFromDb(\r\n                            characterNames?: string\r\n                        ): Promise<Character[]> \r\n    - if any characterNames argument received, it fetches only those characters from db\r\n    - else fetches all characters\r\n    - This handles encryption and decryption of secrets if secrets are present in a character\r\n    - uses env.ENCRYPTION_KEY\r\n- An express server\r\n   - The server starts only when the env AGENT_RUNTIME_MANAGEMENT == true\r\n   - _Why not use the same express server in DirectClient?_ DirectClient does not have access to the DB methods and all the agent-specific handling methods\r\n   - ENDPOINT:  \"/load/:agentName\" METHOD: Post\r\n   - PORT: default. - 3001, overwritten by env AGENT_PORT\r\n4. **in packages/client-direct/src/index.ts**\r\n- Added ENDPOINT:  \"/load/:agentName\" METHOD: Post\r\n   - This endpoint (is a proxy) that routes request to the agent server's route\r\n   -    Before proxying, checks if AGENT_RUNTIME_MANAGEMENT  ==true and if agents already in runtime\r\n5. created a file **packages/core/src/crypt.ts**\r\n- This handles the encryption and decryption methods\r\n6. created scripts that parses a character json file or all files in a folder and inserts in DB\r\n- Location: scripts/importCharactersInDB/[postgres/sqlite]/insertInDb.js\r\nRequires env variable\r\n`\r\nPOSTGRES_URL= # if postgres\r\nENCRYPTION_KEY=\"\"\r\nINPUT_PATH=characters # the folder path to load the characters from\r\nSQLITE_DB_PATH= #if you want to change db path Default: agent/data/db.sqlite\r\n`\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nBug fixes (non-breaking change which fixes an issue)\r\nImprovements (misc. changes to existing features)\r\nFeatures (non-breaking change which adds functionality)\r\nUpdates (new versions of included code)\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- This \"Why\" section is most relevant if there is no linked issue explaining why.

Fetching from database during start\r\n- set env FETCH_FROM_DB=true\r\n- `pnpm start`\r\n- Will function as usual\r\n- if we want to test postgres, set env POSTGRES_URL=''\r\n2. Loading an agent during runtime\r\n- set env FETCH_FROM_DB=false #if true, we can't test load as all characters in db will be loaded\r\n- set env AGENT_RUNTIME_MANAGEMENT=true\r\n- set env ENCRYPTION_KEY= #use the same encryption key used in insertInDB.js script\r\n- set env AGENT_PORT=4000 #can be empty if we want to pick default port 3001\r\n`pnpm start`\r\n- This will load with the default character Eliza\r\n- `curl --location --request POST 'http://localhost:3000/load/trump'` - replace port and character name if using different characters\r\n- SUB SCENARIO 1: agent is loaded and we get success code 200\r\n- SUB SCENARIO 2: agent is already loaded and we get error code 409\r\n- SUB SCENARIO 3: agent does not exist in db and we get error code 404\r\n- SUB SCENARIO 4:  Error during agent load - like incorrect twitter - error code 500\r\n-  if we want to test postgres, set env POSTGRES_URL=''\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nNone, automtated tests are fine.\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n- As [anon/admin], go to [link]\r\n\u00a0 - [do action]\r\n\u00a0 - verify [result]\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- If there is a UI change, please include before and after screenshots or videos.

Please describe.**\n\nThe current logging mechanism in the `/packages/plugin-coinbase/src/plugins` directory lacks consistency and detail, making it challenging to debug and monitor the plugin's behavior effectively.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nIntegrate the `elizaLogger` construct to standardize logging across the plugin. This should include:\n- Consistent log levels (INFO, DEBUG, ERROR) for different operations.\n- Detailed log messages that include context such as function names and parameters.\n- Examples of how to implement `elizaLogger` in existing functions for better clarity.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\n- Continuing with the current ad-hoc logging approach.\n- Using a third-party logging library, though this may introduce unnecessary dependencies.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nPlease refer to existing examples in the `/packages/plugin-coinbase/src/plugins` directory and extend them where possible. Ensure that the new logging strategy aligns with the overall architecture of the `eliza` project.",

Please describe.**\n\nCurrently, the logging mechanism in `/packages/plugin-coinbase/src/plugins` lacks detailed output, making it difficult to trace issues and monitor performance effectively.\n\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\n\nIntegrate the `elizaLogger` construct to provide more comprehensive logging throughout the codebase. This would involve:\n- Adding entry and exit logs for key functions.\n- Including detailed error logging with stack traces.\n- Logging significant state changes and data processing steps.\n\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\n\nConsidered using a third-party logging library, but `elizaLogger` offers a more integrated solution with existing infrastructure.\n\n**Additional context**\n\nUtilize existing examples of `elizaLogger` usage in other parts of the codebase as a reference. Extend these examples to cover more complex scenarios within the `/packages/plugin-coinbase/src/plugins` path.",
