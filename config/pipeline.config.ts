     We are ElizaOS. Our mission is to develop an extensible, modular, open-source AI agent framework that thrives across both Web2 and Web3 ecosystems. We see AI agents as the key stepping stones toward AGI, enabling increasingly autonomous and capable systems.

  Core Philosophy
    Autonomy & Adaptability: Agents should learn, reason, and adapt across diverse tasks without human intervention.
    Modularity & Composability: AI architectures should be modular, allowing for iterative improvements and robust scalability.
    Decentralization & Open Collaboration: AI systems should move beyond centralized control towards distributed intelligence and community-driven progress.
